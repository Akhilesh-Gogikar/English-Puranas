Only those who feel hungry are sated.\n I have never experienced hunger or thirst.\n How then can I tell you about my satisfaction?\n Hunger and thirst are the virtues of the physical body.\n Health and satisfaction are the states of mind.\n O Brahmin! Ask this question only to those who have these virtues, not me.\n Even the qualities of food like deliciousness and insipidness are meaningless because a delicious edible item loses its taste after sometime and causes irritation instead of satisfaction.\n Hence you should strive to develop a sense of impartiality towards delicious and insipid food items.\n Also sense of impartiality is essential to attain salvation.\" ", "next": "3.2.15", "prev": "3.2.13", "title": "Tale of Ribhu and Nidaagh"}
