{"index": "4.3.1", "image": "resized_images/Rameshwar Kshetra.png", "text": " Once, Shaunak and few other sages asked Sutji as to how could a man become free from the bondage of the world. They also inquired whether there was an existence of any such holy place capable of liberating a man from heinous of sin. Sutji replied--' Ramteerth is supreme among all the places of pilgrimage. A mere sight of this holy place is enough to free a man from the bondage of this mortal world. Going on a pilgrimage to Rameshwar gives virtues similar to what is attained by performing all the yagyas. One, who takes a holy dip at Setu Rameshwar, attains to Vishnuloka. Merely by sleeping at the sea shore of Rameshwar a man gets absolved of heinous of sins like brahmhatya, etc. A man is blessed if his remains are consigned to the holy waters at Rameshwar after his death. Scriptures say that five types of sins are as grave as the sin of brahmahatya-- One, who criticizes sages A selfish person who cooks food only for himself, One who destroys well laid path making it difficult for people to tread upon, One who accepts food from a 'chandal' and One who sells food grains to a chandal. But, all these just disappears once the sinner reaches Rameshwar. ", "next": "4.3.2", "prev": "4.3", "title": "Rameshwar Kshetra"}
