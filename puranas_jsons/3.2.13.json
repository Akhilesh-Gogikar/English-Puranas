For those who worship the Lord with a desire to receive wealth and kingdom, these things are a supreme goal.\n For those who want to attain heaven, action in the form of forming Yagya is the goal.\n But the supreme virtue is to act in a selfless way without having a desire for results.\n A Yogi must contemplate on that transcendental soul because it is the only means to merge with that supreme soul.\n\" If the wealth is the goal while it is spent in religious activities.\n If the son is the goal, the father too might have been a goal for someone.\n Thus, there is no supreme goal because everything exists for a time then ceases to exist.\n Hence the assumption of any physical thing as a supreme goal is meaningless.\n And consideration of soul separate from supreme soul is also futile.\n The soul is one, all pervasive, impartial, pure, intangible and transcendental.\n It is free from the cycles of birth and death.\n It can neither be created nor be destroyed.\n It is supremely omniscient.\n Its manifestation in different life forms is temporary and identification of soul with living beings is baseless.\n Soul which is present in scores of living beings is basically single and same.\n Once one comes to know this, he doesn\u2019t remain in darkness.\n Veil of ignorance then parts with him.
