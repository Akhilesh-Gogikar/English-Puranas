After the demise of Kaartaveerya, his ministers and priests decided to crown his son Arjun as their new king.\n But Arjun refused saying that he would not become the king unless and until he had attained the status of a Yogi.\n Sage Garg then advised Arjun to worship Dattatreya who had helped the deities to reunite after the defeat of the demons.\n Afterwards, Arjun migrated to Dattatreya's hermitage and began to worship and serve him.\n Pleased by his penance and service, Dattatreya asked Arjun to seek a boon.\n Arjun said- 'O lord! Kindly bless me with such a power, which enables me to perform my duties as a king in a just manner.\n May nobody match me in war and may I have one thousand arms.\n I wish to get killed only by such a person who is more virtuous than me and may I guide the people towards the right path.\n May nobody in my kingdom remain poor and may my devotion for your lotus feet be eternal.\n' Dattatreya said- 'O son! All of your wishes shall come true.\n With my blessings, you shall rule over all the four directions.\n' Then, Dattatreya crowned Arjun as the king.\n Large number of people witnessed his crowning ceremony.\n Soon after becoming the king, Kaar taveerya Arjun ordered that nobody in his kingdom should wield a weapon except him.
