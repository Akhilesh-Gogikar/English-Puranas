I am no more able to tolerate the humiliation of being a mother of a dull child--Look at your step-brothers, who have achieved fame and respect on account of their learning.\n I have decided to give up my life.\n' Etareva became very sad.\n He started chanting the dwadashakshar mantra regularly and as a result a day came, when he could pronounce it correctly and without stammering.\n One day Etareva happened to pass by a place where a yagya was being performed.\n As soon as he reached that place, the priests found to their surprise that they had become dumb.\n All the priests became restless, as the rituals were still incomplete.\nLooking at their pitiable condition, Etareva chanted the dwadakshar mantra-- OM NAMO BHAGAWATE VASUDEVAY.\n The priest regained their power of speech by the virtue of the flawless pronunciation of the mantra.\n Such is the greatness of dwadakshar mantra.\n Later on, Etareva went on to become a renowned scholar.\n A person who chants this sacred mantra regularly become liberated from all his sins and attains to Vishnu Lok.
