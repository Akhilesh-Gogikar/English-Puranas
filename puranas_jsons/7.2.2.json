You are like our father because you have protected us.\n You are our teacher also because we have gained knowledge from you.\n Now we have grown up, kindly tell us what should we do?\n'.\n The birds speaking like learned people amazed the sage as well as his disciple.\n He asked the birds- 'Tell us, how did you speak so clearly and is there any curse behind your present condition?\n'.\n The birds replied- 'O sage! Long ago, there used to live a sage, Vipulasvan.\n He had two sons- Sukrish and Tumbaru.\n In our previous birth, we were the sons of Sukrish.\n When our father and uncle performed Yagya, we brought them all the required materials.\n One day, Indra arrived at our hermitage disguised as an aged bird.\n The aged bird was starving, hence we requested our father to provide him with some food.\n Upon enquiring by our father, the bird expressed his desire to eat human flesh.\n Our father tried to dissuade the bird but it did not give up its insistence.\n Then our father called us and said that he had promised the bird to feed it with human flesh.\n So, we were asked to donate our body in order to satisfy the bird's hunger.\n But being frightened, we expressed our inability to meet the demand of the starving bird.\n This infuriated our father for we were violating his promise that he had made to the bird.\n He then cursed us to take birth as birds in our next life and himself got ready to donate his body.\n As our father was breathing his last, Indra resumed his real self and said- 'O great sage! I took this guise only to test your character.\n Kindly forgive me and tell me what you desire now?\n' Indra blessed our father to have divine knowledge and penance free from all obstacles.\n Thereafter we also fell at our father's feet and begged for his pardon.\n We requested him to take back his words but he said that his words would not go futile.\n But still he blessed us to have supreme knowledge even in the form of birds.\n' Concluding their talk, the birds said- 'O lord! Thus controlled by destiny, our father cursed us.\n After sometime, we took birth in bird form in the battlefield where you found us and fostered us in your hermitage.\n Now we are strong enough to fly long distances.\n So kindly free us from your obligation.\n' Hearing the words of the birds, sage Shami said to his disciples- 'Look! I had already told you that these birds were no ordinary creatures.\n They even survived the battle of Mahabharat.\n It shows their greatness.\n' Then sage Shami granted them permission to migrate to the Vindhyachal.\n The birds decided to pass their time by studying the Vedas and doing penance as long as they stayed there.
