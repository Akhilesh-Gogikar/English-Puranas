We have assembled here to discuss the most cryptic disciplines of life.\n But it is beyond my powers to answer the questions you have put before me.\n Only a great sage like Suta, who is the most learned disciple of Vedavyasa, is able to answer these questions.\n Presently, he lives in a hermitage in Siddhipeeth.\n Let us all go there and request him to preach us about the cryptic disciplines of life.\n\" Hearing these words, all the sages thanked Shaunak with joy.\n Then, led by Shaunak himself, all of them reached the hermitage of the sage Suta.\n At the hermitage, sage Suta welcomed them all and satisfied their queries.\n He said:\n \" O great sages! I narrate to you, the great Purana, which was once narrated by the great saint Sanatkumar to Devarshi Narad and now known as Narad Purana.\" ", "next": "18.2", "prev": "18", "title": "PENANCE OF THE SAGES IN NAIMISHARN"}
