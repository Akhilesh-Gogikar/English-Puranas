You have accomplished an impossible act.\n If it were not for you I would not have been able to accomplish my own penance.\n Now, you should get rid of this skull and create a holy spring bathing in which would destroy your sin acquired by killing Mahishasur.\n' Goddess Durga hit ferociously at a huge rock breaking it into pieces.\n A large pit was created which was soon filled up with underground water.\n She then took her bath in it by chanting NAMAH SHONADRINATHAY.\n In the meantime, an amazing incident took place.\n While goddess Durga was taking her bath with Mahishasur's skull in her hand, a Shivalinga, which was struck in Mahishasur's throat fell down.\n This Shivalinga later on became famous as 'Papanashan Shivalinga'.\n She then released the skull and came out from the pond.\nArunachaleshwar (Lord Shiva) became pleased by Parvati's devotion and appeared before her.\n Lord Arunachaleshwar then made Parvati to sit by his left side.\n The next moment Parvati's identity mingled with that of Lord Arunachaleshwar.\n The place where this incident took place, there is situated a grand temple of goddess Apitastani and Lord Arunachaleshwar.
