The dead ancestors gave Uma to me on the condition that I would get her married with Shiva.\n The son born to her would kill the demons- Mahishasura and Tarakasura.\n At last Himalaya agreed.\n The Saptarishis were pleased and chose an auspicious moment for the marriage ceremony.\n They said- \"Shiva would marry your daughter on Maitra Muhurta- the third day from today when the Moon will enter the Uttar Phalguni Nakshatra.\n\" After saying this, the Saptarishis returned to Mandaar Mountain and gave the good news to Lord Shiva.\n Lord Shiva became pleased and worshipped the Saptarishis.\n The Saptarishis then went to inform all the deities about Shiva's marriage.
