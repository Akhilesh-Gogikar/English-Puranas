Be pleased upon me.\n The Daityas and the Daanavas have captured all the three worlds from my sons.\n I request you to take birth as my son and defeat the demons.\n' The Sun god agreed to take birth as her son.\n In course of time, Aditi became pregnant.\n She engaged herself in religious activities so that she could become a mother of a virtuous child.\n Seeing his pregnant wife observing fasts, Kashyap became very angry.\n He said- 'It is not proper for a pregnant woman to observe fast as it may prove to be harmful to the foetus.\n Why are you trying to destroy it?\n' Aditi replied- 'I am not trying to destroy my foetus.\n After taking birth, our child will destroy our enemies.\n' In her anger, Aditi released her foetus.\n Kashyap started chanting the mantras of Rigveda.\n In a very short time, her child came out from that foetus.\n A heavenly voice was heard which said- 'O sage! Since you have called this foetus, Maarit, therefore your son would be famously known as Maartand.\n' After the birth of Maartand, the morale of the deities was boosted up.\n Indra challenged the demons.\n A tremendous battle ensued between both the sides.\n Maartand glanced towards the demons as a result of which they were charred to death.\n The deities were pleased and eulogised Maartand.\n At last, the deities regained their territories they had lost to the demons.
