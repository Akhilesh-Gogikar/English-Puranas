Paddy, barley, wheat, lesser cereals, sesame, millet, rice, peas, pulses, beans, rye, gram and hemp are common agricultural produce that have edible as well as medicinal values in the villages.\n These and other produce are also used as oblations in the Yagyas because all of them have produced as a result of Yagyas.\n Performing Yagyas daily is the most virtuous exercise that every human being should undertake.\n This destroys the sins committed by common people.\" ", "next": "3.1.4", "prev": "3.1.2", "title": "Divisions of Earth and Origin of Cereals"}
