Only he had the permission to enter Lord's sanctum. Seeing his friend Krishna in remorse, Uddhav asked: \"Mathuranath, you seem to be upset. What is troubling you?\" Lord Krishna replied: \"Uddhava, I feel perplexed. I remember my days in Vrindavana. Please go to Vrindavana and get the news regarding Gopis there. Also give them my message.\" Thus Lord Krishna donned Uddhav in his attire and sent him to Vraj in his chariot. There he stayed at Nand's home. At night, Uddhav enquired about Nand and Yashoda's well being and about Vraj in general. That whole might passed in chatting.
