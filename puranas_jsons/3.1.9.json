Kindly narrate to us the reason for which Prachetas observed severe penance under the sea.\n Parashar says- Once by the inspiration of Brahma, King Prachin Barhi asked his sons Prachetas to continue the progeny in an honoured way.\n Prachetas agreed to obey the dictate of their father but they asked- O father! Kindly narrate to us, what should we do to enable ourselves so that we could carry out the process of reproduction.\n King Prachin Barhi said that worship of Lord Vishnu was the only thing that enabled a person to achieve his desired objectives.\n He dictated his sons to worship Lord Vishnu.\n It was by the dictate of the father that all the ten Prachetas observed severe penance for ten thousand years under the sea.\n At the end of their penance, Shri Hari appeared before them radiating with blue light like a freshly bloomed blue lotus.\n Accepting the greetings of the Prachetas, Lord Vishnu asked them to seek a boon.\n Prachetas then told the dictate of their father.\n Lord granted their boon.\n Thereafter all the Prachetas re-emerged from the waters.
