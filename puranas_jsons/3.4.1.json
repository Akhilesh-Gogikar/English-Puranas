Now tell me whom should I marry Revati to?\n\" Brahma said- \"That unborn all pervasive Parmeshwar Lord Vishnu had taken an incarnation on earth.\n O king! Your capital at Kushasthali which was equal to Indra\u2019s abode Amravati is now Dwarkapuri.\n In that Dwarkapuri, stays Baldev who is a part of Lord Vishnu.\n Marry this daughter to him because she is a jewel among the women folk and Baldev is praised all over the world by all.\n Hence only he deserves to be your son-in-law.\n\" Hearing the verdict of Brahma, Prajapati Raivat descended on the earth and saw that an amazing transformation had taken place in the appearance of people who were now smaller in stature, ugly, dull and devoid of strength.\n Even his capital Kushasthali had acquired a new appearance and was now known as Dwarkapuri.\n Raivat found out Baldev and married his granddaughter Revati to him.\n But Revati appeared quite large and taller in stature than Baldev because of age difference.\n Baldev pressed her slightly with anterior part of his plough and she assumed a stature equal to normal women.\n After marrying Revati to Baldev, Raivat migrated to the Himalayas to observe penance.
