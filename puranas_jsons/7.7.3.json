With the arising of disenchantment in my heart, I have no miseries now.\n Only those people feel drowned in the ocean of miseries who are attached to worldly things.\n A man feels all kinds of sorrows due to his attachments towards the luxuries in which his mind indulges.\n Now neither sorrow nor joy can affect me.\n' Dattatreya says- 'O king! Whatever you said is correct.\n Attachment is the cause of both sorrow and happiness.\n It is because of the knowledge I gave to you that the 'mist of attachment' has disappeared from your heart.\n A small sprout of ego ultimately develops into a huge tree of ignorance.\n Affection is the trunk of this tree.\n Home and family are the branches and wife and children are the leaves of this tree.\n Wealth and cereals are the flowers and happiness and sorrow are the fruits of this tree.\n Relation that emerges out of affection is the canopy of this tree.\n This tree grows day by day and obscures the path of liberation.\n This tree is full of desires and those who sit under the lee of this tree can never attain salvation.\n Hence felling of this tree is of foremost importance for a person desirous of attaining 'Brahmajitva.'
