All the oceans, as we know are huge bodies of Saline water. How is then the sea of milk? A couplet of Chanakyaneeti explains it thus : KA CHINTA MAM JIVANE YADI HARIIVISHVAMMBHARO GEEYATE, NO CHEDARBHAKA JIVANAY JANANISTANYAM KATHM NIRMYET | ITYALOCHYMUHURMUHURYADUPATE LAKSHMIPATE KEWAL TVATPADAMSHUJASEVANEN SATATAM KALOMAYA NEEYATE || Meaning: If God Hari Vishnu is known as VISHVAMBHAR (feeder of the world) I need not worry for anything in the world. If he were not there, where the milk would come from in the breast of a mother before child's birth. So God filled the breast of a new mother with complete food that is milk. It is clear from the above example that Lord Vishnu assumes different forms just to feed all the creatures in the world, of these different forms of the God, the milk is one. Acording to another principle of scriptures, God is present in every grain. Hence he is also present in the milk also. It is also the supreme duty of the humankind to maintain the original pure form of the milk, because the milk is prone to damage quickly. Similarily, all these desirious of Salvation, must follow Vaishnava religion, otherwise any deviation in it may damage all of their penance.
