There are many more disastrous symptoms that indicate death.\n A Yogi must always be alert regarding these signs.\n Whenever a Yogi perceives the appearance of all or some of these disastrous symptoms, he must at once take to Yoga to minimise the effects.\n Brahmagyan- A Yogi experiences extreme joy when he meditates while doing Yoga.\n Only then can he experience Brahma.\n Physical body is ephemeral;\n hence a true Yogi does not mourn over the loss of physical body.\n Hence, a Yogi must train his mind in Yoga ignoring sorrow or affection.\n This is indeed a difficult task to achieve.\n Alark says- O Brahmin! By your blessings, my ignorance has ended.\n Now I will do everything so that ignorance does not grip me once again.\n Then taking Dattatreya's permission, Alark went back to the king of Kashi and said- 'O king! You have a desire for the kingdom, so take this kingdom and enjoy its luxuries yourself or give it to Subahu.\n' The king of Kashi asked Alark as to why he was renouncing the kingdom without fighting a war.\n He also tried to instigate Alark by saying that his conduct did not suit the Kshatriyas.\n Alark said- 'Only Brahma is truth, all the other things are false.\n Now controlling my senses, I will attain perfection in Yoga.'
