If you wish to see the illusion, come on, have a sight of your deceased wife.\n' Saying this, Naagraj called Madalasa who was staying secretly in his palace and asked Ritudhwaj- 'Take a good look, O son, if she is your wife.\n' Seeing his wife before him, the prince fainted.\n When he regained his consciousness, he stepped forward to touch her but Ashwatar stopped him cautioning that she was not real but illusionary and would vanish as soon as he touched her.\n Hearing this, Ritudhwaj once again lost his consciousness.\n When he regained his consciousness, he uttered nothing but 'She's mine! She's mine!' Seeing the pitiable condition of the prince, Naagraj revealed the whole story of Madalsa's resurrection.\n Ritudhwaj became extremely joyous after re-uniting with his wife.\n Then he contemplated on his divine horse as a result of which, it appeared within a moment.\n Riding the horse, prince Ritudhwaj returned to his kingdom with his wife Madalasa.
