During the night all of them circumambulated the mountain. Lord invoked the Ganges by his wish and bathed Govardhan with her water.Then they put vermilion on it, offered basil- leaves, flowers etc and worshipped it. Brahmins recited hymns in its praise. To make the people believe in their rituals, Lord Krishna himself appeared on the mountain in huge form and exclaimed: \"I am Giriraj (the king of the mountain) and began to eat the offerings. But he as a child was still among the villagers who faithfully bowed before the mountain. Among them, the child Krishna said: \"look, what a surprise Giriraj has appeared himself and bestowed his grace on us. He has accepted our worship.\" There after all the Gopas distributed Prasad among themselves and felt supremely satisfied. ", "next": "16.10.25", "prev": "16.10.23", "title": "Worship of Goverdhan"}
