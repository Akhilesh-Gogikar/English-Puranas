But now, it has been replaced by affection now. He, therefore decided to remove his dilemma. Thus, Lord said to him: \"Kaka, Mathura is still some distance away. So you take a bath in Yamuna. We brothers are waiting for you in the chariot.\" As soon as Akrur took a dip in Yamuna, Lord showed him a sight of His abode Vaikunth and his Narayana's appearance in which, he was holding conch, wheel, mace and lotus in each of his four hands and was lying on the bed of Sheshnaga. With folded hands, Akrur prayed to lord: \"O lord, you are the reason for the existence of Brahma and the Universe. O Lord, I pray at your feet again and again. Now I recognise you. You are the one who took the incarnations of Matsya, Kachchap, Varah, Narsinh, Vamana, Rama etc. Thus after bath and worship, Akrur returned to the chariot. Lord Krishna understood that now a devotional feeling had arisen in the mind of Akrur for Narayana. Lord asked: \"Your condition seems miserable. Did you see anything extra-ordinary under water?\" Akrur said: \"O Lord, now bestow your grace on me. Kindly come to my home and accept my hospitality.\" ", "next": "16.10.37", "prev": "16.10.35", "title": "Appearance of the Lord before Arjun"}
