She requested her companion to ask the moon as to where he was going in such a cheerful mood. The moon told her companion that they were going to attend the yagya ceremony, being organised by Daksha. Sati was very surprised at this information. She went to lord Shiva and sought his permission to go there. Lord Shiva then told Sati that her father did not invite them because of the animosity he was having towards him (Shiva). Sati became very furious and decided to go there to know about the reason why Daksha was performing the yagya without inviting her husband-Shiva. Shiva sent Nandi and other rudraganas as her escorts.
