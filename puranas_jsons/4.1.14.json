Your child is still fearful of the Kaal.\n He is trembling and crying inspite of the best of our efforts to drive away is fears.\n So he will become famous as Kaalbhiti (one who is fearful of Kaal).\n Kaalbhiti grew up to be a virtuous person.\n He used to engage himself in various kinds of austerities.\n He was a great devotee of Lord Shiva.\nOne day, as Kaalbhiti was meditating under a 'bael' tree (wood apple), he went into his trance.\n The joy experienced during trance period was something, which he had never experienced before.\n He decided to regularly meditate under that tree.\n He did penance for one hundred years standing on his toe.\nLord Shiva became pleased by his devotion and appeared in the guise of a human being.\n Lord Shiva said--'O Great soul Please discontinue with your penance.\n I have brought some water for you! Please quench your thirst!' But Kaalbhiti refused to take water from an unknown person.\n He requested Lord Shiva to reveal his identity.\n Kaalbhiti also inquired Lord Shiva about his religion and conduct.\n Lord Shiva told him that he was beyond any religion or conduct.\nWhen Kaalbhiti refused to have water, Lord Shiva dug up a large pit and emptied the pot into it.\n After that he disappeared.\nKaalbheeti stood fixed at that place, being stunned by the disappearance of Lord Shiva.\n Suddenly, an effulgent Shivalinga appeared under that bael (wood apple) tree.\n Kaalbheeti worshipped that shiva-linga which was radiating light in all directions.\nNow, lord Shiva appeared and blessed Kaalbheeti to become free from the fear of Kaal(Death).\n From that day onwards the Shivalinga situated there became famous as Mahakaal.\n Before disappearing once again, Lord Shiva instructed Kaalbheeti to preach Sage Karandham who was expected to visit him shortly.\n Kaalbheeti himself became renowned as Mahakaal because he had been successful in conquering death.
