The cart turned over and all the utensils kept on it came crashing down.\n Even the demon was crushed to death under the cart.\n Other boys, who were playing nearby, informed the Gopis (ladiesfolk) that the little Kanhaiya had turned over the loaded cart, but they did not believe the kids.\n Yashoda ran in horror and lifted the baby in her lap.\n The Brahmins recited pacifying hymns then.\n Thereafter the baby was bathed again with sanctified water.\n A feast of Brahmins followed then.\n Ultimately they were seen off with many gifts.
