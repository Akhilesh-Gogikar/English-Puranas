According to the tradition of our clan, only such a person can marry a woman who defeats her in the battle.\n\" Dundubhi went back to Mahishasura and narrated the whole story.\n Mahishasura instructed Chikshur to go and bring Goddess Durga after enslaving her.\n Chikshur proceeded with a huge army.\n Seeing him coming in the direction of Goddess Durga, Lord Brahma instructed her to use an armour to protect herself.\n The Goddess refused by saying- \"No demon can stand before me in a battle.\n\" All the deities then chanted Vishnupanjar Stotra for her safety.\n Protected by the Stotra, she was successful in killing many demons.\n Seeing his devastated army, Mahishasura himself came to fight her.
