Uma because of her shyness could not say anything. Lord Shiva knew about her desire so he said- \"You will have me as your husband.\" Uma's face beamed with joy, but she shyly requested lord Shiva to keep this proposal before Daksha. Shiva agreed and said- 'Tathastu'. He then went back to his abode- Kailash. Sati narrated the whole story to her parents. Both of them became very happy with this news. Lord Shiva then instructed Brahmaji to put a formal proposal to Daksha regarding his marriage with Sati. Lord Brahma went and informed Daksha about lord Shiva's proposal. Daksha was very happy at the proposal. Brahma then came back to lord Shiva. ", "next": "5.2.40", "prev": "5.2.38", "title": "Shiva Blesses Uma with a Boon"}
