Falling of these eggs and getting safely covered by the bell simultaneously shows that these chicks are no ordinary birds.\n' Then he instructed his disciples to carry the eggs to the hermitage and keep it securely at a place safe from predators. The disciples did as told. ", "next": "7.2.2", "prev": "7.2", "title": "Birth of Four Birds"}
