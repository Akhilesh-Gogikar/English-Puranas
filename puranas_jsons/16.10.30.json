His heart melted at their condition and He appeared amidst them. A sweet smile played on his beautiful face. He wore a garland of fresh Vaijayanti flowers and yellow clothes.

All of them began to embrace Lord and thus quench the fire of separation that was burning their bodies. Thereafter, along with the beauties of Vraj, Lord came to the bank of Yamuna.

Because of it their conscience remains always engrossed in me. Hence, I take to hiding even after meeting so that you could feel complete imbibement in me.
