Satrajit felt ashamed. With a feeling of repentance he took the gem. He was getting afraid also that he made enemity with lord Krishna without reason. Hence to expiate his crime, Satrajit thought of presenting the gem Syamantak and his daughter Satyabhama to Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna accepted Satybhama as his wife but returned the gem to Satrajit saying: \"It is a gift of lord Suryadev. Keep it with you. You are required to deposit the gold that you get from it, in the royal treasure.\" ", "next": "16.10.55", "prev": "16.10.53", "title": "Marriage of Satyabhama & Krshna"}
