Mathura.\n Sushila,his wife was deeply religious but inspite of that she was issueless.\nOne day,she had gone to take her bath in river Saraswati where she found many women taking their bath.\nThe children of these women were playing nearby.\nSushila became very sad and being unable to control her emotions started crying.\n\" \"A sage saw her crying and asked her as to what made her so sad.\n Sushila narrated her woeful tale to him.\nThe sage took pity on her and advised her to worship lord Gokarna.\nThe sage said-'You will definitely be blessed with a son.\n' Sushila went home and narrated the whole incident to her husband.\nBoth of them started worshipping lord Gokarna Mahadev with total devotion.\nAfter ten years,a son was born to them.\n Vasukarn named that child after lord Gokarna to express his gratitude to the deity.\n\" \"In course of time,Gokarna grew up and got married but even after a long time he did not have a progeny.\nSo,his father married him to three more women,one after another, but even this did not prove to be of any help to Gokarna because he remained a sonless person.\nThis made Gokarna very sad and he engaged himself in various charitable activities thinking that the virtues thus attained might bless him in begetting a son.\nHe got constructed many temples and ordered wells to be dug up for the benifit of the travellers.\nVery soon,all his money was spent and he became worried about the future of his family.\nSo,he decided to go to distant places to earn wealth.\n\" \"Once,while on his journey he met a divine parrot who possessed tremendous knowledge.\nGokarna was very much impressed by the parrot's knowledge.\nHe asked the parrot from where had it imbibed such divine knowledge.\nThe parrot revealed to him that he was Shukodar in it's previous birth and was a learned man.\nHe had attained the form of parrot due to the curse of sage Shukdev.\n But,sage Shukdev had been kind enough to allow him to retain all the knowledge in his next birth.\nThe parrot also told Gokarna how it had been kept inside a cage by a fowler and requested him to help it out from the captivity.\n\" \"Gokarna requested the fowler to give the learned parrot to him.\n The fowler agreed but asked for all the virtues attained by Gokarna in return.\nGokarna happily agreed to donate all his virtues and proceeded with that parrot.\nNow, Gokarna had become bereft of all his virtues he had attained so far.\nOnce,while he was on a voyage in connection with his trade the ship was caught in a severe cyclone and the chances of survival looked very bleak.\nAll his fellow travellers had a misconception that they had been struck by the misfortune only because of Gokarna's sins.\nThe parrot was saddened after hearing what people said about his master.\nIt decided to help him and flew away towards north.\nWhile flying it found a vishnu temple where many divine women and other creatures had gathered to worship.\nThe descendants of Jatayu were also among them.\nThe parrot narrated the woeful tale of his master to all of them.\nAll the divine birds decided to help Gokarna.\n\" \"The divine birds instructed the parrot to follow them and then flew towards the place where Gokarna's ship was stranded.\nFinally, they were successful in rescuing Gokarna and bringing him back to the same temple.\nGokarna worshipped lord Keshav and performed the rituals of tarpan in the name of his ancestors.\nIn the meantime,all the divine women also arrived there to worship.\nThey were pleased to meet Gokarna and gave him divine food to eat.\nThey also allowed him to stay there for as long as he wished.\n\" \"Meanwhile the ship managed to reach the sea shore.\nGokarna's companions met his parents and narrated the whole incident to him.\n Gokarna's parents were filled with sorrow at the fate of their son.\nOn the other hand,Gokarna continued to live in that temple for a long period.\nHe was worried about his father as it had been a long time since he saw him.\nHe sent the parrot to bring his news.\nThe parrot flew away to Mathura and met his father-Vasukarn.\n Vasukarn thanked the parrot for saving his son's life.\nThe parrot then flew back on his return journey and gave the good news to Gokarna.\n\" \"One day Gokarna found the divine ladies extremely sad.\nWhen asked,they told him that the king of Ayodhya had destroyed the beautiful gardens of Mathura and this was the reason for their sadness.\n Gokarna assured them that he would convince the king to abandon his evil plan if he got a chance to meet him.\nThe divine women then provided Gokarna with a divine aircraft boarded on which he reached Mathura.\nGokarna met the king and managed to convince him against destroying beautiful gardens.\nThe king was extrtemely impressed by his knowledge and presented great amount of wealth to him.\nThis way all the divine women became happy once again.\n\" \"Gokarna then went home and met his family members.\nHis parents and his wives were very pleased to see him.\nGokarna then got constructed a shukdev temple to honour his saviour-the learned parrot.\nIt was only because of that parrot that he could acquire such wisdom and knowledge.\nTo express his gratitude to the fowler he donated all the virtues he had acquired by taking bath in the holy confluence(triveni) because had it not been for the fowler he would never have got the knowledgeable parrot.Gokarna lived happily for a long time.\" ", "next": "8.8", "prev": "8.7.17", "title": "Gokarn Teertha"}
