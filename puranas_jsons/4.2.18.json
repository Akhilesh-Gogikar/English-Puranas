Get all the four idols coloured on the basis of the complexion of the respective deities.\n The colour of Jagannath's idol should be dark blue similar to that of dark clouds.\n Similarly, the idol of Balbhadra should be coloured in white just like his fair complexion.\n The colour of goddess Subhadra's idol should be reddish just like the rising Sun.\n Sudarshan chakra should be painted deep red.\n Either the descendants of Vishvavasu or your royal priest are entitled to participate in the consecration ceremony of the idols in future events.\n' Indradyumna, once again following the instructions, got the idols coloured in the way specified by the heavenly voice.\n After that, all the four idols were adorned with beautiful apparels and ornaments.\n Now, they really looked divine in their new looks.\n Looking at the divine idols of Jagannath, Indradyumna went into trance.\n Seeing his condition, Narad advised not to waste time and seek any boon from lord Jagannath because the sole purpose for which Jagannath had manifested himself was to bless him and to fulfill his wish.\n Indradyumna immediately realized what Narad meant to say.\n He eulogized lord Jagannath in the following way--' O Jagannath! Help me out from the sorrows of this world.\n I don't aspire for anything else.\n' Subsequently, Narad and the whole entourage, which had come along with king Indradyumna worshipped lord Jagannath, Balbhadra, Subhadra and Sudarshan chakra.\n Lord Jagannath was worshipped amidst the chanting of dwadashakshar mantra while Jagannath was worshipped with Purush sukta.\n Similarly, Subhadra and Sudarshan chakra were worshipped amidst the chanting of Devisutra and vedic verses respectively.\n Finally, donations were made to the brahmins and everybody was sent off with respect.
