I know the prowess of my father.\n I also do not doubt regarding my father\u2019s reverence and greatness.\n I will not commit any crime against him but kindly listen to me what I mean by the endless God.\n\" \"O teachers! There are four attainable goals in one\u2019s life.\n You ask me what have I to do with He, who helps all the human beings to attain these four goals- Dharma, Arth, Kama and Moksha.\n You are my teachers.\n You are free to say anything to me.\n But within me stays He who is the creator of all, who is the preserver of all and who is the destroyer of all of us.\n Kindly forgive me if I have committed any thing wrong in your honour.\n\" The teachers said-\"O foolish boy, we saved you from imminent death thinking that you are our disciple and that you will not balderdash in future.\n But still you speak nonsense.\n Listen, if you don\u2019t drop your stubbornness we\u2019ll have to invoke Kritya the ogress in order to get you slain.\n\" Unfazed Prahlad said that life and death were immaterial for the soul that protects or destroys itself through auspicious and inauspicious deeds.\n Hence one should always strive to behave in an auspicious way.\n But Prahlad\u2019s words further enraged his teachers.\n They invoked the ogress Kritya to get Prahlad slain.\n Kritya hit Prahlad\u2019s chest hard with her trident.\n But as soon as the trident touched his chest it broke into pieces without harming Prahlad.\n Seeing her attempt failed, Kritya killed the teachers and disappeared.\n His teachers\u2019 death caused immense pain for Prahlad.\n Mourning for their death, he prayed Lord Vishnu to resurrect them.\n Hearing his prayers, Lord Vishnu once again granted life to his teachers.\n The teachers got up as if from a deep slumber.\n They realised their mistake and blessed Prahlad and resolved never to have hostility against him.\n Then they went to the palace and informed Hiranyakashipu about all the happenings.
