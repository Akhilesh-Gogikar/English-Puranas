How should one worship Lord Vishnu?\n Kindly describe it to me.\n Parashar says- King Sagar had asked the same thing from sage Aurv.\n I am narrating what sage Aurv had preached him.\n Only those who fulfil their responsibilities and discharge their duties as per their class can worship Lord Vishnu.\n Those who shun activities like criticising others, backbiting, womanising, stealing others\u2019 wealth and violence;\n those who do not torture others and are always ready to serve the gods, Brahmins and teachers are able to please Lord Vishnu.\n Similarly, one should be always conscious regarding his duties as per his class.\n Accordingly, a Brahmin should carry out Yagyas, study scriptures and should not ever try to hurt anybody.\n A Kshatriya must organise Yagyas and study scriptures.\n He should also make donations to Brahmins and take weapons in order to protect the earth.\n A Vaishya must earn his livelihood through cattle rearing, commerce and agriculture.\n Besides he should also organise Yagyas make donations and study scriptures.\n A Shudra is expected to earn his livelihood through handicrafts.\n Saluting learned people is equal to organising Yagya for a Shudra.\n A Shudra may also make donations and oblations to appease his dead ancestors.\n In the time of emergency, a Brahmin may shift to the occupations meant for Kshatriya and Vaishya.\n A Kshatriya may take the occupation of a Vaishya during emergency but none of them should ever take to the occupation of Shudra.
