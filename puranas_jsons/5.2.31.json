All the living creatures were spell bound by his powers except lord Shiva and Ganesha. Kama returned back to Brahmaji ad told him about his unsuccessful attempts. Brahmaji sighed heavily. From his sighes were created the ferocious ganas. These ganas were shouting ''aray-Maray''(Kill-Kill). They eve tried to attack lord Brahma, Kama then pacified the anger of these ganas. These ganas were named as Maar. Lord Brahma then sent these ganas to Shiva along with Kama and Rati to give it a second try. Once again their attempts went futile. All of them returned to lord Brahma and expressed their inability in influencing Shiva. ", "next": "5.2.32", "prev": "5.2.30", "title": "The Creation of Marganas and Kama\u2019s Futile Attempts"}
