Once Kartikeya asked Lord Shiva about the holiest tree, which was capable of giving salvation.\n Lord shiva replied---The Tulsi plant is supreme among all the vegetations.\n She is very dear to lord Vishnu and fulfill's all the desires of a man.\n Lord Krishna dwells near the place where there is a Tulsi plant.\n Spirits and ghosts never dare to venture near the Tulsi plant.\n If a man attaches a Tulsi leaf to his Shikha at the time of his death, he is liberated from all his sins.\n One who worships Lord Vishnu by offering Tulsi-leaves attains salvation.
