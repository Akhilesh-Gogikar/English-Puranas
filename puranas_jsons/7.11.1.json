Don't curse the king.\n The cow must have died because of her own past Karmas.\n' King Prishadhna made salutations to the Agnihotri Brahmin and said in a loud voice- 'Be pleased on me.\n I did not kill the cow deliberately.\n It only happened by mistake.\n The Brahmin replied- 'O king! I have never spoken a lie in my life.\n Even my curse which I have given to you will not go in vain.\n' Sage Mauli took his son to his hermitage.\n In course of time, Prishadhna became a Shudra due to the curse.
