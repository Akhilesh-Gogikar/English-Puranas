I am the lord of all the deities.\n I am the one who controls each and every event that occurs in the Universe.\n I am the one whom mortals worship with the desire of attaining salvation.\n The universe would have ceased to exist but for me.\n I am the creator, the nurturer as well as the supreme annihilator.\n I manifest myself in the sacred mantras as well as their meanings.\n People meditate on me.\n Matter is nothing but a medium through which I manifest myself.'
