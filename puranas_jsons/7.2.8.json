When, King Harishchandra attained his heavenly abode, their family priest, sage Vashishta re-emerged from water.\n He came to know about the entire development.\n He was angry at Vishwamitra's stubbornness.\n He at once cursed Vishwamitra to become a stork.\n On the other hand Vishwamitra cursed Vashishta to become a partridge.\n Thus both of them turned into birds and began to fight.\n Their fight caused great panic all around.\n At last accompanied by the deities, Brahma himself arrived at the scene and dissuaded the birds from fighting.\n But Brahma could not convince them and they continued to fight.\n Brahma then destroyed their avian appearances and both the sages regained their original form.\n Their enemity too ended at the same time.\n Brahma explained to them that Vishwamitra had not done any harm to Harishchandra.\n In fact he had felicitated Harishchandra's ascend to the heaven.\n Both the sages felt ashamed and they embraced each other before leaving for their respective hermitages.
