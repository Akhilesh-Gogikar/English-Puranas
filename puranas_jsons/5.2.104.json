He then boarded the beautiful chariot which had been sent by Parvati and proceeded towards Kailash mountain. All the deities including Shiva were eagerly awaiting his arrival. When Kartikeya reached Kailash mountain, he was given a royal reception. The whole atmosphere was filled up with joy. Everybody was celebrating.
