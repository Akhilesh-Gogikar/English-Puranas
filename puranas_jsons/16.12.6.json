Taking shelter at Mahakaal (Lord Shiva), Markandey had turned away even Kaal (death). And by penance had a sight of Lord Shri Narayana. He prayed God to show His Maya (illusion). Thus Markandey saw the scene of Pralaya. All the creatures were drowning in the deluge. On a leaf of Banyan, then he saw Bal Mukund. Markandey entered Lord's heart and saw endless cosmos there. Then, by God's instinct, Markandey returned to his hermitage. Thus Markandey had the knowledge of Lord's metaphysical state. In the last chapters, a brief content of Bhagwad and glory of Lord's devotion have been discussed. SUTJI says: O great sages, I have described what you have asked on the occasion of this pious assemblage. That voice is useless, which cannot recite Lord's name and can not praise His virtues. All the sins and omens are destroyed by constant recitation of Lord's name. One then receives devotion for Lord with pure heart and begins to experience and feel God's tangible form. Though all the other Purans contain description of Lord's appearance, but in Shrimad Bhagwad Mahapuran, there is profuse description of Shri Hari in every chapter. Shrimad Bhagwad has a confluence of knowledge, asceticism and devotion. One receives devotion for Lord and salvation eventually merely by reciting, listening and reflecting over it.
