With the attainment of knowledge, people come to conjugate with the Supreme Almighty and which results into dispersion of their ignorance.\n To attain Moksha, it is necessary for a man to shun attachment first of all.\n Only after that, he will become free from sorrows.\n When he becomes free from sorrow, he unites with the supreme almighty.\n This phenomenon is known as Yoga.\n Unification with the supreme almighty enables a man to attain knowledge and finally Moksha (salvation).\n It is therefore essential for the all those seeking salvation that first of all they should renounce affection and attachment for the worldly objects including their near and dear ones.\n Knowledge and renunciation are nothing but two sides of the same coin and one is necessary to give rise to the other.\n Home is nothing but the place for staying, food is nothing but the energy required sustaining our body and knowledge is nothing but an aid to attain salvation.\n Anything that caused obstacles in the way of salvation is ignorance.\n A living being is bound to receive the fruits of action no matter whether they are good or bad.\n Hence one should carry out his duties without bothering for the results.\n With the attenuation of the results of the action performed in the previous births, a living being becomes free from the cycles of life and death.\n With the attainment of Yoga, Yogis take refuge in none other than Brahma.\n But the path of attaining Yoga is indeed difficult, if not impossible.\n One has to conquer his soul first of all because the soul itself is regarded as invincible.\n Control of physical impurities with the help of Pranayam, sins by determination, lust by self-restrains and contemplation on God are the ways to conquer the soul.
