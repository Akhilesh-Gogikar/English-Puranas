Lord Shiva then categorised the life-span of a man into four parts - Childhood, adolescence, youth and old age.\n He than told her that it was written in her destiny to die by burning.\n He also advised her to go and surrender her body in the sacrificial fire of the yagya, performed by Medhatithi.\n \"Before jumping into the sacrificial fire, just remember anybody, whom you want as your husband, and your wish would be fulfilled in your next birth, When you would take birth as a daughter of Daksha Prajapati.\n Your father-Daksha Prajapati would marry his 27 twenty daughter to Moon, but the moon would have affection only towards Rohini and rest of his wives would be neglected by him.\n For this reason he would be cursed by Daksha.\n All the deities would take your refuge.\n\" After blessing Sandhya in the way lord Shiva went back to Kailash mountain.
