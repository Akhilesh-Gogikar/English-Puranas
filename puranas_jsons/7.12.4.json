I have a demand.\n Promise me that you will fulfil it.\n' Aveekshit gave his word.\n The king said that he aspired for a grandson but this was impossible unless he (Aveekshit) got married.\n Initially, Aveekshit tried to convince Karandham that it was an impossible task as he had vowed to remain a celibate but ultimately he had to change his mind to honour his words.
