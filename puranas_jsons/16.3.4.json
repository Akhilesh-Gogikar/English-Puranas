But neither do they get pleasure nor is their sorrow removed. Their sorrow increases instead. What is good then, is this context? SUKMAY KARMANI KAROTI LOKE | NA TAIH SUKMAM VANYADUPARAMAN VA || VINDETMUYAS TAT OEVAM DUKHAM | YADATR YUKTAM BHAGWAN VADENNAM || O great among the sages, kindly preach me the way to peace, following which, one meets the God who then takes abode in the heart of his devotee and instills in him the Santan Gyan (eternal knowledge) that lets the devotee feel the direct presence of Him. TAT SADHU VARYADISH VARTM SHAM NAH, SAMRADHITO BHAGWAN YEN PUNSAM || HRIDSTHITO YACHCHHATI BHAKTI PUTE, GYANAM SATA TVADHI GAMAM PURANAM || Thus asked with devotion by Vidurji, Mahatma Maitreya illuminated the glory of God and other events like creation of universe by illusion and origin of colossus body, and said: No one can measure the eternal glory of God and the illusions created by Him. In the beginning God created the primitive elements and the flaws associated with them. Then he created the colossus universe and entered it.
