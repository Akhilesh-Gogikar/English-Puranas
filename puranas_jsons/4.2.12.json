I am amazed how you could make arrangements for all these things at a remote and secluded place like this! How do you manage this?\n Vishvavasu replied-- It is not as difficult as you believe.\n Since Purushottam kshetra is a sacrosanct place and it is frequently visited by the deities who make divine offerings to lord Jagannath.\n I collect the residuals of whatever is offered to Jagannath from the temple and bring it home.\n So, I really don't have to make any special efforts to accumulate divine food stuffs.\n On account of eating these divine food stuffs, not only we have been blessed by eternal youth but also we are never troubled by old age.\nVidyapati was very impressed and requested Vishvavasu to become his friend.\n He also reminded Vishvavasu that he wanted to return as soon as possible so that the king could go on a pilgrimage to Purushottam kshetra.\n But, Vishvavasu made a shocking disclosure to Vidyapati and said-- King Indradyumna will never be able to have a divine glimpse of lord Jagannath as the lord is soon going to disappear.\n But, don't disclose this fact to the king otherwise he would get disheartened and abandon his plan of making a pilgrimage to Purushottam kshetra.\n Finally, when the king in his utter frustration would try to end his life after not being able to have a divine glimpse of Neelmadhav, the most gracious lord will appear in his dream and instruct him to get constructed four wooden idols of Jagannath, Balbhadra, Subhadra and Sudarshan chakra.\n Having accomplished his mission, Vidyapati proceeded on his return journey and once again he visited Purushottam kshetra, which fell on the way.\n He picked up a garland, which had been offered to Neelmadhav by some deity.\nFinally, when he reached Malwa he found king Indradyumna eagerly waiting for him.\n After presenting the garland to the king, he narrated his experiences he had at Purushottam kshetra--' O king! Lord Jagannath's idol is made of Neelmani diamond and is very ancient.\n Even the deities have deep regards and undiluted reverence for lord Jagannath and are frequent visitors to Purushottam Kshetra.\n The garland, which I have given you, was in fact had been offered to Lord Jagannath by the deities- these flowers do not wither and have fragrance lasting for eternity.\n Purushottam kshetra remains untouched by old age, sorrow or disease and gives salvation to anybody, who goes on a pilgrimage over there.'
