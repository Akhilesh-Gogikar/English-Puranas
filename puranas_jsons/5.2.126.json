Vrinda became very restless and when the anxieties become unbearable she proceeded towards the forest. Vrinda saw a hermit in the forest who was preaching his disciples. The hermit was none other than lord Vishnu. She went to that hermit and prayed to save her husband's life. Lord Vishnu disappeared from the scene and reappeared - this time in the guise of Jalandhar. But Vrinda was unable to recognize the real identity of her husband. She was very pleased after finding her husband. Both of them stayed in that very forest as husband and wife for a very long time. One day, came to know about the real identity of the person, who was impersonating as her husband. Realizing that her chastity has been breached, she cursed lord Vishnu by saying that just as he had played a deceitful trick with her in the same way somebody would deceitfully abduct his wife and he too would wander in her search. After cursing lord Vishnu, Vrinda embraced death by entering into the fire. ", "next": "5.2.127", "prev": "5.2.125", "title": "Vrinda Gets Dishonored"}
