A man who takes refuge in Lord Vishnu and surrenders himself to his will becomes liberated from all the miseries and sorrows of life.\n A man who has accepted Lord Vishnu as his master need not fear from anything not even death.\n All the things which are visible in this universe are the various manifestations of Lord Vishnu himself.\n A devotee of Lord Vishnu does not have to go to hell and he becomes liberated from the cycles of birth and death.\n\" This way, Prahlad described about the greatness of Lord Vishnu and his worship in great detail.
