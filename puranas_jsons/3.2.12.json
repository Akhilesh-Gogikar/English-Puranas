First of all, tell me, what do you see directly?", " Your saying that I am carrying your palanquin is also meaningless.", " Now listen to what I say.", " Both my feet are resting on the earth.", " On the feet are thighs, and on the thighs is belly, on the belly are chest, shoulders and arms.", " Your palanquin is resting on the shoulders.", " What load am I carrying then?", " You are in the palanquin and I am on the earth are meaningless words.", " All the creatures, you and me are all carried by the five basic elements.", " Even our virtues are controlled by our action.", " Only action is born out of ignorance.", " The soul is pure, non- degradable, calm, intangible and beyond all nature.", " This same soul pervades all the creatures.", " It neither grows nor decays.", " Why did you say then that I am burly?", " If this palanquin that is resting on my shoulders-chest-belly-thighs and feet, could be a burden for me, it could also be a burden for you.", " Like this, all the living beings are carrying not only this palanquin but all the mountains, trees, houses and even the earth.", "\" Saying this, Jadabharat became silent, still carrying the palanquin.", " The king at once got down from the palanquin and fell at Jadabharat\u2019s feet and said- \"O Brahmin! Leave this palanquin and tell me why have you taken this guise.", " Who are you?", " What is the reason of your coming here?", " I am eager to know about you.", "\" Jadabharat said- \"I cannot tell what I am and for the reason why I came here, I can say only that coming and going are all done so that one can experience their result.", " The soul takes an incarnation only to experience the joy and sorrow as per its deeds.", " Why are you then enquiring specifically about the reason for my coming here?", "\" The king said- \"The soul transmigrates from one body to another only because of its action.", " I want to hear from you preaching regarding \u2018who am I cannot be told\u2019.", " O Brahmin!
