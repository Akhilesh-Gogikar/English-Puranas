\"Don't cry my son, you will be named as Rundra.\n\" So the eleven forms of the baby came to be known as eleven Rundras.\n Rundranis (female Rundra) were also created.\n From Tamas Prakriti (malignant nature) Rundra created the ghosts, the spooks, the spectres, the devils, lamias etc.\n Afraid by their appearances, Lord Brahma prayed Rudra, \" O Mahadev, please stop creating such formidable organisms.\n They are already enough in number.\n Now, you please undertake penance to comfort all the creatures.\n\" Thereafter, Lord Brahma created ten more sons-Marichi, Bhrigu, Kratu, Pulah, Pulatsya, Angira, Atri, Vashishtha, Daksh and Narad.\n Nine out of them took permission for the creation of their offsprings, but Narad accepted celibacy and resolved to preach Bhagwad bhakti (devotion for God.\n) For the continuation of the creation, Lord himself appeared as a female from the left hand and as a male from the right hand of Lord Brahma.\n Those males and females forms were named Manu and Shatarupa respectively.\n They were the first in the whole creation to copulate and bring about sexual reproduction.\n They begot two sons- Priyvrat and Uttanapad, and three daughters- Devhuti, Akuti and Prasuti.\n As the primitive king, Manu was the fosterer of the earth.\n By then a demon named Hiranyaksh abducted the earth and hid it under the abyssimal depth of the ocean, causing worries for Lord Brahma.\n Instantly Lord appeared himself in Varah (boar) incarnation and to do away with Lord Brahma's worries, He at once entered the depth of the ocean and rescued the earth on His long teeth.\n On the way the Lord had an encounter with Hiranyaksh and killed the demon with His wheel.\n Maitreya:\n says Hiranyaksh represented anger.\n Those who don't want to discharge their duties, but still wish to live with all the comforts are abductors of others wealth.\n Such people, who continuously interfere with equal distribution of wealth, must be condemned as the demons.\n On the origin of the demons, Maitreya cryptic said, once Diti, the wife Maharshi Kashyap, expressed her desire to conceive.\n Maharshi Kashyap tried to disuade her that time was not suitable for an auspicious job like conception.\n But Diti kept on insisting and forced her husband shamelessly to assist her in the process.\n Consequently she conceived during the dusk.\n Kashyapji cautioned her \"you will give birth to the demons.\n\" And with the arrival of the demons in Diti's womb, nature began to manifest herself adversely.\n There was terror and famine all around, and darkness prevailed even during day, with stars appearing in the sky.\n Frightened by these manifestations, the gods asked Lord Brahma about the reason of all those disturbances.\n Lord Brahma informed them that two dread demons were to take birth from Diti.\n Those two demons, told Lord Brahma, were the two gatekeepers-- Jay-Vijay, of the Lord's abode.\n Once, Sanakadi Kumar had gone to Vaikunthdham (the abode of God) to see God but those two gatekeepers didn't let them in.\n Sanakadi tried thrice, but only to be stymied every time by those two gatekeepers at the gates.\n Hence, Sanakadi Kumar cursed them to take birth on earth as demons.\n Those two gatekeepers of the God's abode Jay-Vijay appeared first as Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha, second time as Ravan and Kumbhkuran and third time as Duntvakra and Shishupal.
