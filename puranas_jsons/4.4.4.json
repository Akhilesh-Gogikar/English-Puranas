You can understand Kashi's importance by the fact that, though I am capable of reaching any place according to my wish but still, here I am doing this austere penance for the attainment of Kashi.\n I must confess that I have not been successful in my efforts till date.\n If any body thinks that he can attain to kashi just by performing austerities than he is totally wrong.\n Kashi can never be attained to until and unless one has the blessing of Lord mahadeva.\n And one who is fortunate enough to have reached Kashi must under no circumstances leave it till he is alive.\n O Agastya! You are blessed because you had the good fortune of residing at Kashi.\n Please allow me to touch your body, which has acquired holiness due to its proximity to Kashi.\n' Having said this, Kartikeya touched different parts of agastya's body as if he were touching the sacred soil of Kashi.
