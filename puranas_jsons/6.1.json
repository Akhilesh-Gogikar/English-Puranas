Why did Shri Hari take the incarnation of Vaaman?\n Why did Prahlad fight a battle with the deities despite being a devotee of Lord Vishnu?\n How did Sati, Daksha Prajapati's daughter become Mahadev's consort in her next birth?\n I am eager to know the answers to all these questions.\n\" Pulastya replied- \"O Narad! Once, Sati requested Lord Shankar to make arrangements for a permanent abode.\n At that time, Lord Shankar had his abode at Mandaar Mountain.\n Summer season was approaching and Sati quite rightly had apprehensions of living in the open.\n Lord Shankar told her that as he was a recluse, he never felt a need of a permanent dwelling.\n Though Sati was not satisfied by his answers yet she kept quiet.\n This way, both of them continued to live there.\n The summer season had passed and now it was the turn of rainy season to arrive.\n Sati made the same request to Lord Shankar.\n This time, Lord Shankar told her that it was impossible for him to construct a house, as he had no wealth.\n He also told her that he had only a tiger skin as his clothing, the king cobra- his sacred thread, Padma and Pingal (snakes)- his ear-rings and Keval and Dhananjay as his armlets.\n After hearing this, Sati became worried as to how she would pass the rainy season without a home.\n Lord Shankar then assured her that this problem would be easily solved if she lived above the clouds.\n This way, she would remain untouched by the showers.\n After this, both of them ascended towards the sky and started living above the clouds.\n From that day onwards, Lord Shankar came to be known as Jeebhootvaahan (one whose vehicle is the cloud).
