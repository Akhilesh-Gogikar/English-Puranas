Bless me with a boon, which enables me to kill anybody merely by the touch of my hand.\n\" Lord Brahma blessed him and said- \"So be it.\n\" Getting this boon made Mura very arrogant.\n He challenged the deities, Yakshas and Kinnars to fight him but nobody accepted his challenge as they were scared of his power.\n He then entered Amravati- Indra's capital and challenged Indra for a duel.\n Indra became terrified and abandoned his abode- heaven.\n Now, Mura became the lord of heaven and very soon, he invited the other demons to join him in heaven.\n Once, Mura challenged a king named Raghu who was proficient in rituals for a duel.\n At that time, Raghu was busy performing his Yagya.\n He admonished Mura by saying- \"What is the great deal in fighting with the mortals?\n If you are really that brave then you should defeat Yamaraj.\n\" The arrogant Mura then went to Yama loka and challenged Yama.\n Yama was aware of Lord Brahma's boon given to Mura.\n So, he went to take Lord Vishnu's help.\n Lord Vishnu advised him to send Mura to Vishnu loka by any means.
