The purpose of the yagya was the benefit of the common people and it was to last for a millennium. To quench the spiritual curiosity of the sages, SUTJI, the orator of Puranas, also arrived there. Felicitating him, the sages asked SUTJI, \" O great sage, by the grace of Vyasji, you have learned all the Purans, history, religion etc. You also know about all the other subjects as well. So kindly narrate the tale which could surely benefit the common people so that they too can experience the real spiritual joy.\" ", "next": "16.1.3", "prev": "16.1.1", "title": "Performance of Gyan Yagya"}
