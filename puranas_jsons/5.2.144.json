Bless me so that nobody should be able to kill one except lord Shiva.\n\" Lord Brahma blessed him and said- 'so be it'.\n Andhak returned to his kingdom and with the co-operation of his brothers like Prahalad etc he brought even the deities under his control.\n But drunk with power he became very arrogant and started tormenting all the creatures.\n He did not show any respect to the Vedas, brahmin and the deities.
