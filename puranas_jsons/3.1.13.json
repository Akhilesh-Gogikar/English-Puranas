How should one behave with the others?\n Tell me what have learned so far.\n I am eager to know your opinions.\n\" Prahlad said-\"O father, indeed my teachers have taught me in different subjects.\n I have too learned them with heart.\n They taught me that diplomatic policies should be applied in order to train friendship.\n But excuse me father, I see no friend or no enemy, so in my opinion these policies are totally irrelevant.\n Tell me O father what is the use of means when there is nobody to be trained.\n Lord Vishnu is present everywhere.\n In you, in me and in all other creatures.\n Hence instead of using in sinisterly actions, one should use his wits for good and benefit of all.\n\" \"O fortunate one, everybody longs for the throne and a big kingdom.\n But only those attain these things who really deserve and have them in their destiny.\n Even the most inert and imprudent people who are weak and know nothing about the policies get these things because of destiny.\n Hence all those who wish for splendour must strive to accumulate pious actions.\n Those who long for salvation must strive to acquire impartial view for all.\n Such actions please God and when He is pleased all the miseries are attenuated.\n\" Hearing these words, Hiranyakashipu kicked Prahlad hard and ordered his demons to tie him in Naagpaash and throw into the sea.\n The demons obeyed their master and threw Prahlad into the sea after tying him in Naagpaash.\n With Prahlad\u2019s motion great disturbances occurred in the sea, seeing that Hiranyakashipu ordered the demons to cover the sea with huge mountains so that Prahlad could not get a passage to escape.\n When the demons uprooted huge mountains and put them into the sea, Prahlad began to pray God with concentrated mind.
