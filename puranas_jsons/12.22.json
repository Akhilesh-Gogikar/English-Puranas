Initially, Krishna did not have any sons Desirous of obtaining a son, Krishna went to visit the sage Upamanyu. The sage\u2019s hermitage was beautiful. Wonderous were the trees and flowers and grew there. The constant chanting of the Vedas could be heard. Wild animals lost their ferocity as soon as they entered the hermitage. Lotus flowers bloomed in the ponds. Sages came from all over the country to meditate in the hermitage. The sacred river Ganga flowed past the hermitage. Krishna greeted the sages and they worshipped him in return. Upamanyu welcomed Krishna with various offerings and said, \u201cOur meditation has been amply rewarded by your visit. The great Vishnu has himself come to grace us by your presence. But is there any particular reason as to why you have come to the hermitage?\u201d \u201cI wish to meet Shiva,\u201d replied Krishna. \u201cHow does one get to met him?\u201d \u201cShiva appears if a devotee performs difficult tapasya,\u201d said Upamanyu. \u201cIt helps if the meditation is accompanied by great faith.\u201d Hearing these words, Krishna began a difficult religious rite known as pashupata vrata. He donned clothes made out of the barks of trees, smeared ashes on his body and continuously chanted Shiva\u2019s name. After many years had passed, Shiva and Parvati appeared before Krishna. \u201cKrishna, why are you performing tapasya?\u201d asked Shiva. \u201cYou are the great Vishnu himself. Any object that you desire is immediately attained. Why are you then engaged in this task of meditation?\u201d \u201cI wish to have a son who is just like you,\u201d said Krishna. \u201cPlease let him also be devoted to you.\u201d Shiva gladly granted the boon and the son who was born was Shamba (alternatively, Samba). He was the son of Krishna and Jambavati. (Stories about Shamba are to be found in the Vishnu Purana, and also in Mahabharata.) ", "next": "12.23", "prev": "12.21", "title": "KRSHNA\u2019S TAPASYA"}
