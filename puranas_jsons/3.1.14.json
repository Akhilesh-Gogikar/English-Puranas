I am pleased with your devotion.\n You may seek any boon of your wish.\n\" Prahlad said- \"May I always have an unconditional devotion for you.\n May your remembrance never be away from my heart.\n\" God said - \" Your devotion for me shall always remain the same.\n Now, seek anything you wish.\n\" Prahlad said- \"O Lord! My father has always cultivated hostility for you because of my devotion.\n May my father be free from the sin of his action.\n\" Lord said- \"O Prahlad! All your wishes shall come true but still seek any boon of your choice.\n\" Prahlad said- \"O Lord! I don\u2019t want anything other than devotion for you.\n\" Lord said -\" O Prahlad! You have nothing in your mind but devotion for me, so with my grace, you will attain supreme abode.\n\" Saying this, the Lord disappeared.\n In later course, ultimately Hiranyakashipu decided to kill Prahlad himself.\n He tied Prahlad to a pillar and shouting abusively for God, he hit the pillar.\n As soon as he hit the pillar, it broke and Lord appeared from it in Narsimha incarnation.\n His appearance was extremely formidable with half human and half lion form.\n Dragging Hiranyakashipu to the threshold, He killed him with his powerful talons.\n After the killing of his father, Prahlad took over the throne and ruled his subjects religiously.
