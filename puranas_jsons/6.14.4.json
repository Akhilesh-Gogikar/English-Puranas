Due to the sins acquired by criticising the Vedas, he would be born in the family of the notorious demon Hiranyaaksh.\" Lord Shiva then asked Ven to demand any boon. Ven requested Lord Shiva to bless his attendant who had transformed into a dog due to his sin acquired by eating divine food. Lord Shiva blessed the attendant as a result of which, he regained his original form. Right then, Prithu arrived there. After seeing him, Ven expressed his gratitude for his tremendous effort without which, he would not have been liberated from his sins. After blessing Prithu, Ven departed for heaven. In his father's absence, Prithu continued to rule justly. He performed many religious activities and gave unlimited donations to the Brahmins. After ruling for a long period, he went to Kurukshetra where he did a severe penance and attained the supreme abode after his death. ", "next": "6.15", "prev": "6.14.3", "title": "Ven Attains Heaven"}
