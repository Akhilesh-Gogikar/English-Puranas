Karambh while he was doing penance in the river.", " Rambh became so dejected by his brother's death that he decided to give up his life by severing his head and offering it in the sacrificial fire.",

possessed lot of animal wealth like goats, lambs, oxen, elephant, horses, cows etc.", " Rambh saw a beautiful buffalo in the cowshed.", " He started caressing her body just to appreciate her beauty.",
