There is a holy place called Padma teerth, not far from Somnath temple. A devotee should first get his hair removed at Somnath teerth and then immerse them at Padma teerth. This way he becomes absolved of all his sins. Women should have a symbolical cut of their hair. It is necessary to perform the rituals of tarpan in the names of ancestors after the head tonsuring ceremony. According to the scriptures, an ocean is considered holy and nobody should its holy water in an impure state. While bathing a devotee should chant the following mantra- 'Om namo Vishnu guptaaya Vishnu rupaaya namah; Saannidhye bhava devesh saagare lavanaambhasi.' There are about five crore Shivalingas submerged in the ocean near Somnath. There are also other holy places situated nearby like Agnikunda, Padma sarovar etc. ", "next": "4.7.8", "prev": "4.7.6", "title": "The Significance of Getting One\u2019s Head Tonsured"}
