Now tell me about the Auttam Manavantar.\n' Markandeya replied- 'Uttanpada and Suruchi had a son named Uttam.\n Uttam was married to Bahula.\n Bahula did not love Uttam and always showed disrespect towards him.\n One day, while both of them were sitting in the court, watching the proceedings, Uttam offered a betel leaf to Bahula which she refused, King Uttam felt dishonoured.\n He ordered his attendant to abandon the queen in the forest.\n Bahula too was very happy, thinking that now she will not have to be in the company of Uttam.\n This way, Bahula was taken to the forest.\n One day, a sad Brahmin came to Uttam and said- 'O king! Somebody has abducted my wife.\n I need your help in finding out my lost wife.\n Uttam asked the Brahmin about the nature, physical construction and about the age of his wife.\n The Brahmin revealed all the facts related with his wife.\n The king was not impressed.\n The facts, which the Brahmin had furnished, went to prove that his wife was not a chaste lady.\n The king expressed his view about his wife in so many words.\n He said- 'What is the use of having such a wicked wife?\n Forget about her.\n I will give you another one with all the good qualities.\n' The Brahmin replied- 'O king! It is one's duty to protect one's wife no matter how wicked she may be.\n By protecting your wife, your children also get protected.\n A man who does not protect his wife, has a son of hybrid class.\n His ancestors are degraded from the heaven because of such type of sons.\n I am not able to perform my religious obligations because of the absence of my wife.\n O king! Please help me.\n' While searching the Brahmin's wife, King Uttam saw a sage at a secluded place.\n When the sage saw King Uttam, he wanted to offer some Ardhya (some type of offering) to him, which his disciples prohibited him from doing.\n Then, the sage changed his mind and offered his seat to the king.\n The king asked about the reason why he changed his mind of offering the Ardhya.\n The sage replied- 'Though you are the descendant of Swayambhu Manu, but since you have committed a grave sin by abandoning your wife, I decided that you are not fit to be offered the Ardhya.\n No matter how mean your wife is, it is your duty to protect her at all costs.\n' King Uttam was very ashamed of himself.\n He asked the sage about the whereabouts of the Brahmin's wife.\n The sage replied- 'His wife has been abducted by the demon, Balaak- the son of Adri.\n He has kept her in the forest called Utpalaavat.\n Go and help the Brahmin to meet his wife so that he doesn't commit a grave sin like you.\n 7.\n9.\n3.\n2 Brahmin\u2019s Wife Returns Home Markandeya says- 'When King Uttam reached Utpalaavat forest, he saw a woman eating a Shriphal fruit.\n The king asked that woman whether she was the wife of that Brahmin- Susharma.\n The woman replied in the affirmative and said- 'The demon abducted me while I was sleeping.\n Since that day, he has kept me here.\n I am very afraid of that demon.\n' The king then asked the woman about the demon's whereabouts.\n The woman pointed towards the direction of the demon's path.\n The king went in that direction.\n When the demon saw the king approaching him, he bowed down in reverence and said- 'O king! What can I do for you?\n' The king asked- 'Why have you abducted the wife of this Brahmin.\n' The demon replied- 'I am not the demon who devours human beings.\n I devour their 'flaws'.\n I have many beautiful wives.\n So where is the need of aspiring for another woman?\n Actually, the Brahmin is a very learned man and has mastered the mantras.\n By chanting Rakshodna mantras during oblations, he has increased my hunger by making incantations.\n Therefore, I have abducted his wife to prevent him from accomplishing any Yagya.\n' The king became very sad.\n He thought- 'What a grave sin I have committed by abandoning my wife! Earlier, that sage too did not find me fit for giving Ardhya.\n Now, this demon is also aware of the importance of one's wife in religious ceremonies.\n How cruel I have been to my wife.\n' The demon told the king- 'O king! What should I do for you?\n' The king replied- 'Devour the flaws of this woman so that she becomes humble.\n After that, carry her back home.\n The demon acted as per the instructions of King Uttam.\n As a result, the Brahmin's wife became very humble.\n She said to the king- 'It seems, there is no fault of this demon.\n Perhaps, I must have caused separation between a husband and wife, in my previous life and for that very reason, I was forced to suffer this separation with my husband in this present life.\n The demon said- 'O king! What else do you want from me?\n The king said- 'You must be present before me whenever I remember you.\n' The demon agreed.\n He carried the Brahmin's wife to her home.\n 7.\n9.\n3.\n3 The Sage and King Uttam Markandeya says- 'King Uttam wondered as to what should he do to get liberated from the sins of abandoning his wife.\n He requested the sage to help him in this regard.\n The sage informed the king that his wife was living at Ranatal.\n The king of the serpents- Kapotak is looking after her.\n Kapotak has a daughter named Nanda.\n Being concerned about her mother's future, Nanda had hidden your wife.\n The sage became very furious and cursed her.\n As a result, she became dumb.\n Uttam, your wife was always a chaste woman.\n It was only due to evil influences of the planets that she was not paying adequate attention to you.\n Now, you should go and take her back to your home.\n Uttam returned back to his palace.\n' 7.\n9.\n3.\n4 The Birth of Auttam Manu Markandeya says- 'Uttam met the Brahmin and told him that now as he had reunited with his wife, it was now his turn to help him (king) to re-unite with his wife.\n The Brahmin assured Uttam that he would perform a Yagya named Mitravinda, which would help him to achieve his goal.\n He requested Uttam to bring his wife so that the Yagya could be performed.\n Uttam remembered Nisachar, a demon and requested him to bring his wife.\n Nisachar went to Pataal loka and brought his wife.\n The queen was very happy to see her husband once again.\n She requested him to cure Nanda who had become dumb for no fault of hers.\n Saraswat Japa was chanted to cure Nanda.\n When Nanda regained her voice, she came to the oblation site and after embracing the queen, blessed her by saying that she would become a proud mother of a very famous son named Manu.\n After that, she went back to Pataal loka.\n In due course of time, the queen gave birth to a son who was named Auttam by the sages.\n ' 7.\n9.\n3.\n5 Auttam Manavantar Markandeya says- 'O sage! The following Ganas who reigned during Auttam Manavantar are very famous.\n They are the first Gana- Swadhama.\n The second Gana- Satya was related with the deities.\n The third Gana was Shiva, the fourth was named Pratardan and the fifth Gana was Vashvarti.\n Each of the Ganas are the master of twelve deities.\n Indra by the name of Sushaanti rules all the three worlds by the virtue of accomplishing one hundred Ashwamedha Yagyas.\n He along with Shiva and Satya etc.\n bestows peace to the world.\n The descendants of Auttam ruled the whole earth for the full period of Auttam Manavantar.\n The Saptarishis during this Auttam Manavantar were the sons of sage Mahatapa.\n The description of this third Manavantar is now complete. Now I am going to tell you about the fourth Manavantar, which is also known as Taamas Manavantar. ' ", "next": "7.9.4", "prev": "7.9.2", "title": "Auttam Manavantar Begins"}
