This way, Lord Shiva became famous as Kapaali.\n This was the reason why Daksha did not invite him.\n In the meantime, Jaya, sage Gautam's daughter went to see Sati at Mandaar Mountain.\n Seeing her alone, Sati asked about her two sisters, Jayanti and Aparajita.\n Jaya revealed to her that both of them had gone to their maternal-grandfather's (Daksha) Yagya.\n Jaya also told her that all the deities had been invited to the Yagya.\n When Sati heard this, she was grieved and angry with her father.\n In a fit of rage, she gave up her life.\n Seeing her lifeless body, Jaya started wailing.\n Lord Shiva arrived there and upon hearing Jaya's wails, asked her why Sati was lying on the ground.\n Jaya then narrated the whole story.\n Lord Shankar became so infuriated that it resulted in the creation of numerous Ganas among whom Veerbhadra was the most prominent one.\n Lord Shiva accompanied by the Ganas went to the site where Daksha was performing the Yagya.\n A tremendous battle ensued between them and the deities and finally, the deities were overpowered and ran away from the site.\n Veerbhadra, finding the time opportune, entered the oblation site.\n When the deities saw him entering the oblation site, they returned and tried to prevent him from doing so.\n Again, an intense battle erupted between both the sides.\n The deities used all kinds of weapons but they could not control the onslaught of Veerbhadra and fled.\n Veerbhadra then went near the sacrificial fire.\n The sages were terrified and ran towards Lord Vishnu who attacked Veerbhadra with arrows but it did not hurt him at all.\n Vishnu then attacked him with other divine weapons.\n But still, Veerbhadra succeeded in neutralising those weapons.\n Vishnu was enraged and attacked him with his Sudarshan chakra that Veerbhadra swallowed.\n This angered Lord Vishnu further.\n He lifted Veerbhadra and dashing him to the ground, pressed Veerbhadra's stomach as a result of which, the Sudarshan chakra came out from his mouth.\n But Lord Vishnu spared Veerbhadra's life.\n Veerbhadra then went to Lord Shiva and narrated his woeful tale of defeat.\n Lord Shiva instructed Veerbhadra to leave for a safer haven and himself went to the oblation site accompanied by Bhadrakali.\n The sages became scared on seeing his terrifying appearance.
