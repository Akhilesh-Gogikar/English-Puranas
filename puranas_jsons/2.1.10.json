Your death is certainly due to some flaw of Sri Ram.\n Now, your mother and I have decided to give up our lives as there is no point in living.\n\" Sri Ram's heart was filled with grief and he asked Sage Vashishth as to how the brahmin could be helped.\n Sage Vashishth revealed to Sri Ram that the brahmin's son had died a premature death because of Shambuk.\n Vashishth said--\"Shambuk is a Shudra by birth, but he is doing an austere penance.\n Shudras are not entitled to do penance in all the three yugas, except the Kaliyug.\n So, only his death can bring back the brahmin's son alive.\n\" Sri Ram instructed both his younger brothers--Laxman and Bharat, to look after the state's affairs in his absence and went in search of Shambuk boarded on his Pushpak Viman.\nSri Ram saw a man doing penance at the shore of a reservoir.\n He landed his Pushpak Viman and went near that man.\n He introduced himself and enquired about the man's identity--Sri Ram asked--Why are you doing such an austere penance.\n Who are you?\n Without moving the man replied that he was a shudra named Shambuk.\n He said---- I am desirous of attaining to devaloka and hence I am doing this penance.\nSri Ram took out his sword and severed Shambuk's head.\n All the deities hailed Sri Ram and the brahmin's child became alive once again.
