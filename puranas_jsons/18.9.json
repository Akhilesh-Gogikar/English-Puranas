Kindly narrate the tale of the Ganges\u2019 origin from the feet of lord Vishnu.\n\" Sanatkumar says:\n Long ago, in the beginning of creation, one sage Kashyap had two wives Diti and Aditi.\n They both were the daughters of Daksha.\n Aditi was the mother of the gods while Diti had given birth to demons.\n Thus, the demons and the gods were stepbrothers and fought accordingly for the power and prestige.\n Demons were elder.\n Hiranyakashyap, the demon king was the son of Diti.\n His son Prahlad was a great devotee of Lord Vishnu.\n In the lineage of Prahlad, occurred the great king Bali who was the son of Virochan.\n Bali had conquered entire earth and was now eyeing the heaven.\n Bali had two ministers, Kubhand and Koopkarna and an equally prowessive son Baan.\n With a huge army, Bali launched a massive attack on heaven and soon a fierce battle broke out.\n The battle lasted for one thousand years.\n At last, the gods lost the heaven to the demons and began to wander here and there in search of solace.\n Defeating the gods, the king Bali organized many Ashwamedha Yagyas.\n Feeling sorry for the plight of her sons, Aditi began a severe penance on the Himalayas.
