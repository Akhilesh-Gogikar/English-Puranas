After becoming liberated from these flaws a man can easily attain six types of accomplishment - talent (Pratibha), super power of hearing (Shravan), excellent conversational power and power of speech (Vrata), Divine sight (Darshan), Divine power of taste (Aswad), Divine power of touch (Vedana). The capability of seeing things situated at distant places is called 'Pratibha'. The ability to listen without making any effort is called 'Shravan'. The ability to decipher the meaning of animal's language is called 'Vrata'. Being able to see divine things without making any effort is called 'Darshan'. The power, which enables a man to know about the taste of a thing without actually tasting it, is called 'Aswad'. 'Vedana' means the knowledge of all types of touch.
