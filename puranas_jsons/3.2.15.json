Today, the king of our town had taken out a procession.\n So I am standing here waiting for the dispersion of crowd so that I can reach home and offer my worship.\n\" Ribhu asked- \" It appears from your words that you know everything about your town.\n Kindly tell me who is the king and who are the subjects?\n\" Nidaagh said- \"The one who is riding an elephant is the king and those who are following him on the ground are his subjects.\n\" Ribhu said- \"O Nidaagh! You have shown me the king and the elephant together but did not show their distinguishing symptoms separately.\n Who is the king among them and who is the elephant?\n\" Nidaagh said- \"The one who is above is the king and the one who is beneath is the elephant.\n\" Ribhu said- \"Kindly elaborate what is above and what is beneath?\n\" As soon as Ribhu finished his words, Nidaagh climbed on his shoulders and said- \"Look, like the king, I am above you and like the elephant, you are beneath me.\n\" Ribhu said- \"If you are like the king and I am like the elephant, kindly explain to me, who are you and who am I?\n\" Nidaagh at once climbed down and fell at Ribhu\u2019s feet and said- \"Certainly, you are the great sage Ribhu.\n\" Ribhu said- \"Yes, I am Ribhu and I have come to preach you out of affection.\n\" Thereafter Ribhu preached Nidaagh on the universality of soul and development of impartial view and left.\n By his preaching, Nidaagh\u2019s ignorance dispersed and he began to see all the creatures equal to impartially.\n O king! Like the Brahmin who attains salvation because of impartial view, you also develop an impartial view regarding soul.\n Then you will not see anyone separate from you.\n Everything in this world is a manifestation of soul.\n Parashar says- \"Thus preached by Jadabharat, the king of Sauveer left his partial attitude.\n Jadabharat too received salvation when he realised the true knowledge.\" ", "next": "3.3", "prev": "3.2.14", "title": "Ribhu Preaches Nidaagh"}
