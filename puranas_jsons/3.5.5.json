even to the gods.", " Kindly grant me my desire.", " Show me my six sons who were killed by Kansa.", " By their mother's dictate and helped by Yogmaya, both the brothers reached Sutal Loka.", " The demon king Bali welcomed them there and offered them a seat, and washed their feet.", " King Bali then asked God what could he do for Him.", " Lord said:", " O demon king, in Swayambhu Manvantara, six sons were born to Urna the wife of Prajapati Marichi.", " They were all gods.", " They had once seen Brahma trying to copulate with his own daughter and hence derided at him.", " Indignant Brahma had then cursed them to take birth in demon incarnation.", " They therefore were born as the sons of Hiranyakashipu.", " In the present era, Yogmaya had made them born as Devaki's sons who were killed by Kansa.", " They are all now in your Loka.", " Mother Devaki is mourning for them, so we shall take them with us.", " They will thus be freed from the curse and go to their heavenly abode.", "\" Thus Lord Krishna and Balaram brought those six babies to Dwarka and handed them to mother Devaki.", " Seeing her babies again, Devaki's heart filled with love for her sons.", " Milk began to flood her breasts.", " She breast-fed them.", " Drinking the milk, all the babies received salvation.", " They then departed to their heavenly abode.", " LOVE AND MARRIAGE OF SUBHADRA AND ARJUN King Parikshit asked:", " \"Gurudev, how did my grandfather Arjun and grandmother Subhadra got married?", " I want to hear this tale.", " Kindly narrate it to me.", "\" Shukdev said:", " Parikshit once travelling on a pilgrimage tour, Arjun reached in Prabhas region.", " There he learned that Balaram was desirous of marrying his sister Subhadra to Duryodhan.", " But Vasudev and Krishna were not in the favour of this marriage.", " So, a strong urge took hold in his mind to get Subhadra as his wife.", " Acting as per the urge, Arjun reached Dwarka in the guise of Vaishnav sage.", " It was rainy season then, so with an excuse of Chaturmasya Vrata (four months long fast), Arjun stayed in Dwarka.", " During his stay, Balaram served and looked after him very well.", " But neither Balaram nor any other inmates of the palace could recognise Arjun.", " Once Balaram invited Arjun to his home.", " There he offered good, delicious food to Arjun.", " Subhadra too served him well.", " There, they fell in love with each other.", " Later on, boarding a chariot, Subhadra went out of the palace for a joy ride.", " At the outskirts of the town, Arjun was awaiting for her.", " He had already taken permission of Devaki-Vasudev and Krishna.", " Subhadra too had silently nodded her acceptance.", " So that evening Arjun and Subhadra eloped from Dwarka.", " The news of Subhadra eloping with Arjun first outraged Balaram.", " But Lord Krishna and other near and dear ones convinced and pacified him.", " RELEASE OF SHIVA FROM CRISIS Maitreya asked:", " \"Gurudev, those among the gods, human beings and the demons, who worship Lord Shiva, get wealth very soon.", " But those, who worship Lord Narayana, remain afflicted with scarcity.", " What is the reason for that?", "\" In reply, Lord Krishna had said:", " \"O Yudhishthir, I take away all the wealth from those whom I bestow my grace.", " When they are poor, their relatives desert them.", " I even render their efforts useless when they try to earn money.", " Thus being unsuccessful repeatedly, the people develop an attitude of indifference for wealth.", " Then they begin to take shelter as my devotee and mingle with me.", " Only then, I bestow my full grace on them and they receive me as Sachchidanand ParaBrahma.", " Thus, pleasing me through my worship is extremely difficult.", " Hence, ordinary people give me up and worship other deities, which are in fact different forms of me.", " Lord Shiva is Ashutosh and bestows his devotees quickly with grace.", " He gives wealth and other riches to his devotees.", " But once they get wealth, the devotees become despotic and even forget the God who had blessed them.", "\" Once upon a time, there was a demon Vrikasur.", " He had pleased Lord Shiva and sought a boon that the person, upon whose head the demon put his hand, should be incinerated at once.", " Lord Shiva granted the boon without considering the consequences.", " But as soon as the demon got this supernatural power, he ran to incinerate Lord Shiva first.", " The demon was eyeing Gauri Parvati, so he was determined to eliminate Lord Shiva.", " Now afraid of his own boon, Lord Shiva ran for his life, with the demon following him in hot pursuit.", " At last Shiva reached in Vaikunth and told Lord Vishnu about his crisis.", " Lord at once illumined the demon and made him put his hand, on his own head.", " By the virtue of the boon, the demon was incinerated in no time and thus Lord Shiva could be saved.", " TESTING OF TRINITY Once upon a time, all the sages assembled on the bank of Saraswati River.", " A dispute erupted among them as to who among the trinity was the greatest.", " By consensus they appointed sage Bhrigu to test the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh.", " Bhrigu reached to Brahma, but did not greet him.", " Brahma got infuriated but since the sage Bhrigu was his son, He did not curse him.", " Then Bhrigu visited Shiva.", " Lord Shiva proceeded to embrace the sage.", " But instead of accepting Shiva's welcome, the sage began to abuse Him, saying:", " \"You violate the dignity of Vedas, so I will not meet with you.", "\" Angry Shiva raised his trident to kill him, but Bhagwati stopped Him.", " At last Bhrigu reached Vaikunth to see Lord Vishnu.", " Lord was lying with head in the lap of Lakshmi.", " Bhrigu kicked hard at His chest.", " But instead of getting angry, Lord got up, bowed his head before the sage and begged pardon:", " \"O Sage, pardon me, I could not welcome you at once, at your arrival.", " Your feet are soft, I hope they are not hurt.", " All my sins have been washed by the touch of your feet.", "\" Bhrigu felt very pleased by the serious talks of Lord.", " His heart felt overwhelmed with excess of devotion.", " He returned to the assembly of the sages and narrated his experience.", " Since then Lord Vishnu is regarded as the Supreme and giver of peace and fearlessness.", " REVIVAL OF BRAHMN'S DEAD CHILDREN There in Dwarka lived a Brahmin.", " When the first son was born to his wife, it died immediately after birth.", " The Brahmin took his dead son to the royal court and complained:", " \"My Son has died because of anti-Brahmin and licentious actions of the king.", "\" One by one, thus, eight sons were born to the Brahmin couple;", " but they all died immediately after birth.", " And the Brahmin kept on dumping his dead sons at the gate of the royal palace.", " When his ninth son was born, and died, Arjun was also there in Dwarka.", " He made a promise to the Brahmins:", " I shall guard your son or commit self- immolation.", " At the time of next delivery, the agitated Brahmin came to Arjun.", " Training his bow and arrows, Arjun made all arrangements to protect Brahmin's tenth son.", " Sanctified by many mantras, Arjun's arrows constructed a fence around the labour room. A child took birth; but it too died after some time. Brahmin, then, cursed Arjun. Arjun scouted through all the three worlds and even the netherworlds in search of the Brahmin's dead son, but he could not find him anywhere. Ultimately accepting his failure and as per his promise, Arjun proceeded to immolate himself. Meanwhile, Lord Krishna too learned about Arjun's vow and stopped him from self-immolation. Thereafter, riding a divine chariot, Lord set out with Arjun, towards west. Beyond the limits of cosmos. They reached the abode of Lord Vasudev in Tripadvibhuti. There Arjun saw that Lord was present in Purushottam\u2019s appearance. Shri Krishna and Arjun greeted Him. Lord Purushottam said in a serious voice: \"O Krishna and Arjuna, only to have a sight of both of you, I brought the Brahmin's sons to me. Both of you had taken incarnation on earth from my part to protect the religion. All the demons have been slain by now. Now you too return to me. Shri Krishna and Arjun again greeted Lord and returned on earth with all the sons of the Brahmin. Arjun was greatly surprised to see the supreme abode of Lord. He felt that whatever strength a living being had, it been all by Shri Krishna's grace. Like common, ordinary people, the Lord stayed on earth enjoying mundane comforts, performed Yagyas like kings, behaved like idealistic people; deterred His subjects and slayed evil kings to re-establish religion on earth.
