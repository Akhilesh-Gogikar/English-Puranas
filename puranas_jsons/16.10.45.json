the deaf and dumb Gopis, But be careful if you put your head at the feet of Radha.\n Get away, we have already seen enough of flattery and flirtation of your friend.\n Deserting our affection for ephemeral things, we loved that eternal one.\n but He too abandoned us.\n Can you guess about our condition?\n Tell us, O Uddhav, shall we ever get the sight of Shri Krishna again?\n Hearing the tragic tale of the Gopis, Uddhav too felt very sorry for them.\n He felt as if Mathuranath, lord Krishna was indeed neglecting those Gopis.\n Uddhav stayed in Vrindavana for six months.\n There he saw every place, every spot where lord Krishna had played once.\n When he was returning to Mathura, mother Yashoda presented him with butter, Radha gave him the flute.\n Thus immersed in the love and overwhelmed by its feelings, Uddhav reached Mathura.\n He said to Krishna:\n \"Lord, the real appearance of love, that I saw in Vrindavana is the only truth.\n\" Shri Krishna said:\n \"Uddhav, You are weeping.\n Just look at me.\n\" Uddhav looked at him with wide, opened eyes.\n In every single hair of Lord, there existed Gopis.\n Uddhav was indeed a Savant. But Lord had sent him to Braj only to be taught a lesson of love. ", "next": "16.10.46", "prev": "16.10.44", "title": "Bhramar Geet"}
