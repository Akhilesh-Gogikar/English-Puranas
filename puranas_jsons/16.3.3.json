The news deeply moved him. In search of solace, he continued to wander from one place of pilgrimage to another place. During his wandering, when he reached the banks of the river Yamuna, Vidurji met Uddhavji the selfless and calm server of God. They both met affectionately and enquired about the wellbeing of each other. They were both reflecting on the plays of Lord Krishna and feeling extreme joy. Vidurji had also got the news of departure of Lord Krishna to his abode and destruction of Yadavas by fierce infightings. So he was extremely depressed also. Uddhavji told him that Lord Krishna himself had bestowed His grace on him and preached Bhagwad gyan, which He had once preached to Lord Brahma. By the dictate of Lord, Uddhavji was going to Badrikasharma. So he suggested Vidurji to see Maitreya for the metaphysical knowledge, for before departing to his abode, Lord Krishna had dictated him (Maitreya) to preach Bhagwad to Vidurji. As per the suggestion, Vidurji reached Haridwar and saw the sage Maitrey on the banks of the river Ganges.
