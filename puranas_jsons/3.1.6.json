Suniti speaks the truth but you don\u2019t worry for no one can do away the virtues of your deeds that you performed in your previous birth.\n Hence you should not feel sorry over such petty things.\n If you feel really sorry by the words of your stepmother why don\u2019t you try to gather virtues?\n Why don\u2019t you try to be a gentle and altruistic person?\n\" Thus consoled by mother Dhruv said- \"Mother! Since now onwards, I will do every such thing so that I may attain the most respected position in the world.\n I am no longer desirous of getting a position granted by others.\n I will achieve the same position as my father has.\n\" Saying this Dhruv left the palace and the town and reached a dense forest.\n Seven Munishwars (mendicants) were already present in the forest.\n Dhruv greeted them all and said very politely- \"O great sages! I am the prince Dhruv.\n King Utaanpaad is my father and his younger queen Suniti is my mother.\n I have arrived here out of desperation.\n\" The sages said- \"O prince! You are just a small boy.\n You have no reason to be worried because your father is still alive and neither you have any disease.\n What then caused you such a severe desperation?\n\" Dhruv narrated the whole events and also that how his stepmother Suruchi ridiculed about his inferior position in the palace.\n The sages said- \"O prince! Kindly tell us whatever you have decided to do to change your destiny and also tell us if we can help you in any way.\n\" Dhruv said-\"O sages! I neither long for wealth or for the kingdom.\n I simply long to enjoy such a position that nobody have ever enjoyed earlier.\n Kindly help me and guide me what I should do to attain such a position.\n\" Marichi said-\"O prince! Nobody can attain such an unparalleled position without the worship of Govind (an epithet of Lord Vishnu), so you also worship that eternal Supreme Being.\n\" Atri said- \"He who is far above the tangible can only satisfy Him and bring you that supreme position.\n\" Angira said-\"Go and worship Govind who holds the entire universe within Him.\n\" Pulastya said-\"Even the wretched people attain the rare salvation worshipping Hari.\n\" Pulaha said-\"Go and worship that Vishnu worshipping whom even Indra attained the position of the gods\u2019 king.\n\" Kratu said- \"Go and worship Janardana who is supreme, who is deity of the Yagyas and Yagya Himself.\n\" Vashishta said-\"O son! You will attain whatever you wish by worshipping Lord Vishnu.\n\" Dhruv said - \"O sages! At my prayers all of you told me about whom I should worship.\n Now kindly tell me what should I do to please the Lord.\n\" The sages said- \"It is imperative for a person, who wishes to worship Lord Vishnu that first of all, he should expel all other menial thoughts from his mind and replace them with the contemplation Lord alone.\n O prince! Thus concentrate on that omnipotent eternal Lord with the mantra - \u2018OM NAMO BHAGWATE VAASUDEVAAY\u2019 .\n Your grandfather Swayambhu Manu had himself recited this mantra during the previous age and had received the perfection of his desire from the Lord.\n So you too go and recite the same mantra in order to please Lord Vishnu.\" ", "next": "3.1.7", "prev": "3.1.5", "title": "Dhruv\u2019s Migration to the Forest"}
