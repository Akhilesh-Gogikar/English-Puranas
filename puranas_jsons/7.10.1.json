It is only because of you that I can create, nurture and annihilate.\n You are the protector of this universe created from the Panchatatvas.\n Please subdue your radiance so that I can commence my creation.\n' Vivasvaan Surya became very pleased by Brahma's eulogy and subdued his radiance.\n Thus, it became possible for Lord Brahma to begin his creation.\n He created the deities, demons, human beings, animals, vegetation etc.\n in the same way as he had done in earlier Kalpas.
