He is the light independence and from of knowledge in himself. He causes illusions even for the most knowledgeous ones. Yet, He is far beyond all the illusions. In Shrimad Bhagwad, created by the great sage Vyasaji, There is a description of the supreme religion, which is free from desire. There is also a description of Paramatmatatva ( the metaphysical entity) that every pious people with holy spirit must know about. Shrimad Bhagwad is a delicious and relishing fruit of Vedas. Because of a touch of Shri Shukacharya's lips, it is impregnated with blissful nectar. So, as long as there is life in his body, a devotee keeps on relishing this nectar of divine scripture. It is easily available right here on the earth itself. ", "next": "16.1.2", "prev": "16.1", "title": "Obeisance to the Supreme Being"}
