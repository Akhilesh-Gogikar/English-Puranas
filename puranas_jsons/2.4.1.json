You had to go into exile only because of me.\n I can never be absolved of my sin.\n' Sri Ram consoled him and after taking Bharat into his embrace enquired about his welfare.\n He told Bharat that he had to undergo the sufferings of exile because of his own destiny.\n'You are not at fault.\n Don't curse yourself for my misery.\n' said Sri Ram.\n At last all of them including Bharat boarded Pushpak Viman and the aircraft took- off for Ayodhya.\nContinuing with Sri Ram's tale, Sheshnag said--When Sumanth brought the news of Sri Ram's arrival at Ayodhya, people danced in joy, Preparations started being made for Sri Ram's grand reception.\n The whole city of Ayodhya was decorated with rows of lighted lamps.\n Sri Ram and Sita alighted from the Pushpak Viman and both of them were carried in a palanquin to the palace.\n People stood in queues on both sides of the road with folded hands.\n Sri Ram blessed them by raising his hand.\nFirst of all Ram went to meet Kaikayi who was full of remorse and guilt.\n Sri Ram consoled her and then went to meet Sumitra to pay his obeisance to her.\n At last, he went to meet his own mother--Kaushalya, who was dying to see him.\n Kaushalya blessed Sri Ram, Sita and Laxman.\n Bharat then instructed the royal astrologers to decide upon an auspicious moment for Sri Ram's coronation.\n Thus Sri Ram became the king of Ayodhya.\n During his reign peace and prosperity prevailed everywhere.\n People were virtuous and there was no sign of sin.
