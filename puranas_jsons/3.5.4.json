You cannot kill me.\n Your killer has taken birth.\n Lord Hari had been your death in your previous births.\n In this birth also He will kill you.\n So from now on, make efforts for your benefit only.\n Saying this Jagdamba vanished.\n Worried by the words of Yogamaaya, Kansa called a meeting of his prominent demons and said -\"These evil gods have hatched a conspiracy to kill me.\n But being a brave man, I do not take these gods into account.\n You have yourself witnessed how Indra fled before the shower of my arrows.\n You would also remember how the clouds rained heavily in my kingdom when Indra had forbidden them from raining on a kingdom and I had pierced them with my arrows.\n All the things on earth except my father-in-law Jarasandh bow before me in fear.\n I don\u2019t care for the gods.\n Even their efforts to kill me make me laugh.\n But still I must not take the word of Jagdamba lightly that my killer had taken birth.\n We should therefore kill all the children who have taken birth within the past few days.\n\" Instructing the demons Kansa approached Vasudev and Devaki in the prison and released them apologising his cruel action in the way of killing their innocent children.
