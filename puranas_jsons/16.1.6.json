He was the son of Maharshi Parashar and Satyawati then known as Matsyagandha. Vyasji was a partial incarnation of the God. Vedvyasji effected a division of Vedas, created Puranas conceptualized history (Mahabharata-which was actually jotted down by none other than Lord Ganesha.) He also established different faculties for teaching his disciples. Yet staying in his hermitage at the banks of the river Saraswati, he was not satisfied with his performance. Something was still writhing within his heart to come out. So he was feelling upset and was unable to find a reason for his dejection. Just then, Devarshi Narad arrived there, and saw that Mahatma Vyas was upset. As nothing was concealed from Naradji, he told him the reasons for his moroseness.
