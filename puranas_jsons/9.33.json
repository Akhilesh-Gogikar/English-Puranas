{"index": "9.33", "image": "resized_images/KANDU.png", "text": " There was a sage named Kandu.\n He had a hermitage on the banks of the Goutami Ganga.\n The ashrama was a beautiful place and Kandu performed very difficult tapasya there.\n In the summer Kandu meditated in the hot sun, in the monsoon he meditated on the wet ground, and in the winter he meditated dressed in wet clothing.\n Indra got sacred as a result of all this tapasya.\n He thought that the sage Kandu might want to become Indra the king of the gods.\n He therefore called an apsara named disturb Kandu\u2019s tapasya.\n Pramlocha went to the hermitage and began to sing there in a beautiful voice.\n This disturbed Kandu and he discovered a beautiful woman wandering around in his ashrama.\n \u201cWho are you?\n\u201d Kandu asked the woman.\n \u201cI have come here to pluck flowers,\u201d replied Pramlocha.\n \u201cI am your servant.\n I will do whatever you wish me to.\n\u201d Kandu had fallen in love with Pramlocha and he married her.\n He forgot all about his tapasya and Indra heaved a sigh of relief.\n Years passed.\n Pramlocha wished to return to heaven, but Kandu would not let her.\n After years and years had passed, Kandu came out of his hut, looking rather distracted.\n It was then evening and Kandu was obviously going somewhere.\n \u201cWhere are you going?\n\u201d Pramlocha asked.\n \u201cWhat a stupid question!\u201d exclaimed Kandu.\n \u201cCan\u2019t you see that it is now evening?\n I have got to go and observe the evening rites.\n The day has passed.\n\u201d \u201cWhat day?\n\u201d asked Pramlocha.\n \u201cSeveral days have passed and several evenings have come and gone.\n\u201d \u201cNo, you came here this morning,\u201d said Kandu.\n \u201cI brought you to my hut and it is now evening, I don\u2019t understand what you are trying to say.\n Explain yourself.\n\u201d \u201cIt is true that I came here in the morning,\u201d answered Pramlocha.\n \u201cBut that was a morning which dawned many years ago.\n Hundreds of years have passed since that day.\n\u201d \u201cHow many years?\n\u201d asked Kandu.\n \u201cWhen did you come here?\n\u201d \u201cSixteen hundred years, six months and three days ago,\u201d replied Pramlocha.\n \u201cAre you sure?\n\u201d asked Kandu.\n \u201cIt seems like a single day to me.\n\u201d \u201cI am sure,\u201d said Pramlocha.\n \u201cI dare not lie to you.\n\u201d \u201cYou have dislodged me from my tapasya,\u201d responded Kandu.\n \u201cBut I will not curse you, since you have been my wife.\n Go back to heaven.\n I have to atone for my sins.\n\u201d The sage Kandu went to Purshottama kshetra and performed penance for his sins.\n He was blessed by Vishnu.\n Kandu and Pramlocha had a daughter named Marisha.\n The Brahma Purana also describes several other tirthas.\n Most of these are on the banks of the river Goutami Ganga.\n This is now identified as the river Godavari.\n After describing these several tirthas, the text describes incidents in Krishna\u2019s life.\n These we will skip, since they are described in much greater detail in the other Puranas.
