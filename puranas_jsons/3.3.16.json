This statement is endorsed by the following tale. Once upon a time, a battle occurred between the demons and the gods. It lasted for one hundred years at the end of which period, the demons defeated the gods. The humiliated gods reached Ksheersagar and prayed Lord Vishnu. Pleased by their prayers, Lord Vishnu appeared before the gods. All the gods greeted Him and said- \"O Lord! In sheer violation of Brahma\u2019s dictate, formidable demons have kidnapped even our due shares offered in the oblations. Protect us from the onslaught of the demons. We cannot fill them because they abide by their religion. Kindly show us a way to kill the demons.\" Hearing the pleas of the gods, Lord Vishnu produced Mayamoha from His body and giving them to the gods, said- \"Mayamoha will cause illusion in the minds of the demons. The illusion will influence the demons to violate the path shown by the Vedas. You can kill them after that\". Saying this, the Lord disappeared. The gods took Mayamoha and reached the abode of the demons. ", "next": "3.3.17", "prev": "3.3.15", "title": "The Battle of Gods and Demons"}
