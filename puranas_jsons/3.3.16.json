In sheer violation of Brahma\u2019s dictate, formidable demons have kidnapped even our due shares offered in the oblations.\n Protect us from the onslaught of the demons.\n We cannot fill them because they abide by their religion.\n Kindly show us a way to kill the demons.\n\" Hearing the pleas of the gods, Lord Vishnu produced Mayamoha from His body and giving them to the gods, said- \"Mayamoha will cause illusion in the minds of the demons.\n The illusion will influence the demons to violate the path shown by the Vedas.\n You can kill them after that\".\n Saying this, the Lord disappeared.\n The gods took Mayamoha and reached the abode of the demons.
