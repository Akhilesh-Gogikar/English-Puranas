Lord Brahma narrated the tale of Tripurasur. \"After the killing of Tarakasur, three of his sons started doing their penance. The eldest among them was Tarkasha, younger to him was Viddyunmali and Kamalaksha was the youngest. I (Brahma) became very pleased by their tremendous penance.\" \"They requested me to create three invincible forts for them, which should be full of all kinds of wealth and splendour and which nobody could be able to break.\" \"A golden fort was constructed for Taraksha; for Kamlaksha a fort of silver was constructed and for Viddyunmali iron-fort was constructed. I had ordered the demon named Maya to construct these forts. One of these forts was constructed in the sky, the other was constructed on the earth and the third was constructed in the nether world.\" \"After constructing the forts for them Maya took the responsibility of protecting them. I (Brahma) warned the three demons that they would be killed by lord Shiva. After this I came back.\" ", "next": "5.2.115", "prev": "5.2.113", "title": "Yudh-Khand: Tripurasur- The Three Demon"}
