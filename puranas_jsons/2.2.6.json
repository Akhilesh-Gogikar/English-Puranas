Who are you?\n From where did you acquire such divine knowledge.\n' Kunjal, who remembered everything about his previous birth said-- In my previous birth, I was the youngest son of a brahmin named Vidyadhar.\n My name was Dharma Sharma.\n Seeing my dislike for study, my father became worried about my future.\n I used to waste my time loitering here and there.\n People used to make fun of my stupidity, which made me extremely sad.\n I decided to acquire knowledge but did not find anybody willing to teach me.\n In due course of time I became old but was still an idiot.\n One day, I was sitting in a temple cursing my fate.\n Suddenly, a sage arrived there and asked me as to what made me so sad.\n I narrated my woeful tale.\n The sage felt pity on my condition and blessed me with divine knowledge that made me capable of having advance knowledge of all the future incidents of the world.\n Sage Chyavan was curious to know about the reason that made Dharma Sharma to be born as a parrot.\n Kunjal replied--- O Brahmin! A man is influenced by the company he keeps.\n The reason why I took birth as a parrot is related with an incident, which occurred in my previous birth.\n Once, a wicked fowler sold a parrot to a brahmin who in turn presented it to me.\n With the passage of time I became very attached with the parrot and gradually deviated from my virtuous path.\n As a result all my divine knowledge vanished and I became an idiot once again.\n One day,a cat arrived and killed that parrot in my absence.\n I became very sad and used to spend my time crying over the dead parrot.\n Ultimately I died but even at the time of death, my mind was preoccupied with the thoughts of my beloved parrot.\n As a result, I was born as a parrot but fortunately I remembered my previous birth even while I was still in my mother's womb.\n I was full of remorse and used to curse myself for having wasted my life.\nSage Chyavan was amazed by the narration of Kunjal--the learned parrot.
